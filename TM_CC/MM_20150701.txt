After a ¡°body language¡± meeting we had a ¡°vocal variety¡± meeting. 
Our ¡°amiable¡± lady Dana noticed us the five elements of ¡°vocal variety¡±: volume, rate, pitch, quality and pause.
Obama¡¯s speech on Fathers¡¯ day became today¡¯s material for practice. How appropriate it is.
All four pairs of speakers showed their different but enchanting voice.
