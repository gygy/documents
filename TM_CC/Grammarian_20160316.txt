Dear toastmasters, I'm very pleased to today's grammarian.

I will carefully observe the language used in the meeting: pronoun(代词), tense(时态), singular or plural（单复数）, comparatives （比较级）or superlative（最高级）,  pronunciation, sentence structure, and particular phrases.

I not only take note of improper language, but also exceptionally skillful usage. 

These days alphaGo one A.I. was under the spotlight.  Here I means intelligence.

So the word of today is intelligent. It means someone or something is good at learning, understanding and thinking in a logical way about things.

Intelligent has the similar meanings of clever, bright.

One example: Jason is intelligent and has a lot of insight.
