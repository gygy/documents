Dear toastmasters, I'm very pleased to today's grammarian.
I carefully observe the language used in the meeting: word choice, pronunciation, sentence structure, and particular phrases. I not only take note of improper language, but also exceptionally skillful usage. 
Today's word is "Never". A easy word but a tricky word. because there is a saying: "Never say never". this means we must think over before you say this word. I will record the usage of this during the meeting.
