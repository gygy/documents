Table Topic opening

Body language is very important for a speech. It can help speaker express himself more effectively and feel relax on this stage. In fact there is totally no voice at the beginning of movie history, those were called silent movie. And Mr. Chaplin the super star let the audience laugh and feel funny. 
I think we should feel such funny in toastmaster club. But it is not always like this. In my CC10 I shared my fear of this stage, I fear to forget the word and become nervous. And especially for table topic session I’m very nerve because of no preparation. What shall I say if I have no interesting story. And I believe many of you have this feeling. 
But today everything changes: the table topic speaker will not speak any more, he or she did not need any preparation. He or she just come to this stage and pick a word. Please do not read it! Just imitate, just use your body language to express.
The audiences will guess and speak out what he or she is performing.
The speaker can pick another word only if we have more than 3 audiences guess the word correctly.
And the time limit is still 2 minutes.
All these 42 words are listed on the blackboard and I had some prints for those who can’t see the board clearly.
And I will do an example first.
OK who will be the first one to eat the crab?
