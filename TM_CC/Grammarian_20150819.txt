Dear toastmasters, I'm very pleased to today's grammarian.
I will carefully observe the language used in the meeting: word choice, pronunciation, sentence structure, and particular phrases. I not only take note of improper language, but also exceptionally skillful usage. 

Word of the day: Incredible  美 [ɪn'kredəb(ə)l]  英 [ɪn'kredəb(ə)l]

ADJ If you describe something or someone as incredible, you like them very much or are impressed by them, because they are extremely or unusually good. 极好的表赞许
Eg1: The wildflowers will be incredible after this rain.

ADJ If you say that something is incredible, you mean that it is very unusual or surprising, and you cannot believe it is really true, although it may be. 难以置信的
Eg2: It seemed incredible that people would still want to play football during a war.
