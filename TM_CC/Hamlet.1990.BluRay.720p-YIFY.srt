14
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,450
Hamlet, think of us as of a father...

15
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:41,283
for let the world take note:
You are the most immediate to our throne.

16
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:45,075
And with no less nobility of love...

17
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:48,242
than that which dearest father
bears his son...

18
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:52,867
do I impart toward you.

19
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:05,700
Though yet of Hamlet
our dear brother's death...

20
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:07,700
the memory be green...

21
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,825
and that it us befitted
to bear our hearts in grief...

22
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:17,325
and our whole kingdom
to be contracted in one brow of woe...

23
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:23,366
yet so far hath discretion fought
with nature...

24
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,950
that we with wisest sorrow think on him...

25
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:31,075
together with remembrance of ourselves.

26
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,908
Therefore our sometime sister,
now our queen...

27
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:42,908
the imperial jointress
to this warlike state...

28
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,866
have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy...

29
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:51,033
with one auspicious
and one dropping eye...

30
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,825
with mirth in funeral
and with dirge in marriage...

31
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:58,283
taken to wife.

32
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,200
And now, Laertes,
what's the news with you?

33
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:20,741
You told us of some suit.
What wouldst thou beg, Laertes?

34
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:24,408
My dread lord, my thoughts and wishes
bend again toward France...

35
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:27,366
and bow them to your gracious leave
and pardon.

36
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:30,241
Have you your father's leave?
What says Polonius?

37
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,200
He hath, my lord, wrung from me
my slow leave by laborsome petition...

38
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:39,033
and at last upon his will...

39
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,366
I sealed my hard consent.
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

40
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:45,450
Take thy fair hour, Laertes.

41
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:50,533
Time be thine,
and thy best graces spend it at thy will.

42
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,783
Farewell.

43
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,866
Hamlet?

44
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:31,241
And now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son.

45
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:35,116
A little more than kin, and less than kind.

46
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:42,241
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

47
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:45,366
Not so, my lord, I am too much in the sun.

48
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:50,325
'Tis sweet and commendable
in your nature, Hamlet...

49
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:53,033
to give these mourning duties
to your father.

50
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:56,408
But, you must know,
your father lost a father.

51
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,575
That father lost, lost his.

52
00:08:01,658 --> 00:08:04,866
But to persever
in obstinate condolement...

53
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,325
is a course of impious stubbornness.

54
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:14,325
'Tis unmanly grief.
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven.

55
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:17,700
For your intent
in going back to school in Wittenberg...

56
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:19,950
it is most retrograde to our desire.

57
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:21,908
Be as ourself in Denmark.

58
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:25,450
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

59
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,533
Good Hamlet...

60
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:43,074
cast thy nighted color off...

61
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:47,449
and let thine eye
look like a friend on Denmark.

62
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,783
Do not for ever with thy veiled lids...

63
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,366
seek for thy noble father in the dust.

64
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,616
Thou knowest 'tis common.

65
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,074
All that lives must die...

66
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:06,366
passing through nature to eternity.

67
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,741
Ay, madam, it is common.

68
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:19,033
If it be,
why seems it so particular with thee?

69
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:23,033
Seems, madam! Nay, it is.

70
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:26,116
I know not "seems."

71
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:29,824
'Tis not alone my inky cloak,
good mother...

72
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:34,366
together with all forms, moods,
shapes of grief, that can denote me truly.

73
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:39,616
These indeed seem, for they are actions
that a man might play...

74
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:44,658
but I have that within which passes show.

75
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:48,866
These but the trappings
and the suits of woe.

76
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:51,824
Let not thy mother
lose her prayers, Hamlet.

77
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:03,033
I pray thee, stay with us.
Go not to Wittenberg.

78
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,574
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

79
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,033
This gentle and unforced accord
sits smiling to my heart.

80
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:50,866
That this too too solid flesh would melt...

81
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:56,033
thaw and resolve itself into a dew.

82
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:04,741
Or that the Everlasting had not fixed
his canon against self-slaughter.

83
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:09,116
O God!

84
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:16,033
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable...

85
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:18,741
seem to me all the uses of this world.

86
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:24,283
Fie on it!

87
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:28,866
'Tis an unweeded garden
that grows to seed.

88
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:35,991
Things rank and gross in nature
possess it merely.

89
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,616
That it should come to this.

90
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:46,616
But two months dead.
Nay, not so much, not two.

91
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,033
So excellent a king...

92
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:54,366
that was, to this, Hyperion to a satyr.

93
00:11:57,741 --> 00:12:02,033
So loving to my mother that he might not
beteem the winds of heaven...

94
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:04,199
visit her face too roughly.

95
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:07,866
Heaven and earth, must I remember?

96
00:12:09,658 --> 00:12:11,324
Why, she would hang on him...

97
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:14,991
as if increase of appetite
had grown by what it fed on.

98
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:18,949
And yet, within a month...
Let me not think on it.

99
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:21,782
Frailty, thy name is woman!

100
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,866
Dear Ophelia,
my necessaries are embarked.

101
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:35,741
Farewell.

102
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:40,074
And, sister...

103
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:46,991
for Hamlet, and the trifling of his favor...

104
00:12:47,074 --> 00:12:49,657
hold it a fashion and a toy in blood.
No more.

105
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:53,866
- No more but so?
- Think it no more.

106
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:58,199
Perhaps he loves you now,
but you must fear...

107
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:00,949
his greatness weighed,
his will is not his own...

108
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:03,699
for he himself is subject to his birth.

109
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,949
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
carve for himself...

110
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:10,907
for on his choice depends
the safety and health of this whole state.

111
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:14,991
Then weigh what loss
your honor may sustain...

112
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:17,699
if with too credent ear you list his songs.

113
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:26,616
Yet here, Laertes?
Aboard, aboard, for shame!

114
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:30,824
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
and you are stayed for.

115
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:33,699
There, my blessing with thee.

116
00:13:36,324 --> 00:13:39,491
These few precepts in thy memory
look thou character.

117
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:44,491
Give thy thoughts no tongue,
nor any unproportioned thought his act.

118
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,366
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.

119
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:55,449
Those friends thou hast,
and their adoption tried...

120
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:58,491
grapple them unto thy soul
with hoops of steel.

121
00:13:58,532 --> 00:14:00,366
Beware of entrance to a quarrel...

122
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:03,199
but, being in, bear it
that the opposed may beware of thee.

123
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:05,782
Give every man thine ear,
but few thy voice.

124
00:14:07,074 --> 00:14:09,949
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy...

125
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,991
but not expressed in fancy.
Rich, not gaudy.

126
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:15,866
For the apparel oft proclaims the man.

127
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:19,907
Neither a borrower, nor a lender be.
For loan oft loses both itself and friend...

128
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:22,407
and borrowing
dulls the edge of husbandry.

129
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:35,282
This above all: To thine own self be true...

130
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:39,032
and it must follow, as the night the day...

131
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:41,866
thou canst not then be false to any man.

132
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:54,991
The time invites you.
Go, your servants tend.

133
00:15:03,574 --> 00:15:06,782
Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
what I have said to you.

134
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:10,991
'Tis in my memory locked,
and you yourself shall keep the key of it.

135
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:31,824
What is it, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

136
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:36,657
So please you,
something touching the Lord Hamlet.

137
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:38,824
Marry, well bethought.

138
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:43,032
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
given private time to you.

139
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,574
He hath, my lord, of late
made many tenders of his affection to me.

140
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:47,740
Affection?

141
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:54,074
Do you believe his tenders,
as you call them?

142
00:15:57,074 --> 00:15:59,740
I do not know, my lord,
what I should think.

143
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:01,574
I will teach you.

144
00:16:02,824 --> 00:16:04,949
Tender yourself more dearly.

145
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,115
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
in honorable fashion.

146
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,490
Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to!

147
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:18,282
And hath given countenance to his speech
with almost all the holy vows of heaven.

148
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:20,574
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.

149
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:26,365
I do know, when the blood burns, how
prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows.

150
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,782
I would not, in plain terms,
from this time forth...

151
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:31,490
have you give words
or talk with the Lord Hamlet.

152
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,282
Look to it, I charge you! Come your ways.

153
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:44,574
I shall obey, my lord.

154
00:17:03,074 --> 00:17:04,949
Hail to your lordship!

155
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:07,824
Horatio, or I do forget myself.

156
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:12,490
- How fare you, sirs?
- My lord.

157
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,324
I am very glad to see you.

158
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:17,657
But what, in faith,
make you from Wittenberg?

159
00:17:18,324 --> 00:17:22,740
- A truant's disposition, good my lord.
- I would not hear your enemy say so.

160
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:25,199
I know you are no truant.

161
00:17:26,782 --> 00:17:29,032
But what is your affair in Elsinore?

162
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,657
My lord, I came to see
your father's funeral.

163
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:33,824
I pray thee, do not mock me,
fellow student.

164
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:36,407
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

165
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:38,865
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.

166
00:17:38,949 --> 00:17:40,740
Thrift, Horatio.

167
00:17:41,282 --> 00:17:45,490
The funeral baked meats did
coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.

168
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:54,490
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
ere ever I had seen that day, Horatio.

169
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,490
My father, methinks I see my father.

170
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:04,490
I saw him once. He was a goodly king.

171
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,657
He was a man, take him for all in all.

172
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:10,657
I shall not look upon his like again.

173
00:18:13,282 --> 00:18:14,282
My lord...

174
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:19,532
I think I saw him yesternight.

175
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:22,157
Saw? Who?

176
00:18:25,282 --> 00:18:27,574
My lord, the king your father.

177
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,157
The king, my father?

178
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:34,324
Season your admiration for a while
with an attent ear...

179
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:38,490
till I may deliver, upon the witness
of these gentlemen, this marvel to you.

180
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:45,740
For God's love, let me hear.

181
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,115
Two nights together
had these gentlemen...

182
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:51,324
in the dead waste and middle of the night,
been thus encountered:

183
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:54,365
A figure like your father
appears before them.

184
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:59,115
Thrice he walked by
their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes...

185
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,157
within their truncheon's length...

186
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:04,490
whilst they, distilled almost to jelly
with the act of fear...

187
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:06,824
stand dumb and speak not to him.

188
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:09,532
This to me in dreadful secrecy
impart they did...

189
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,074
and I with them
the third night kept the watch...

190
00:19:12,157 --> 00:19:16,990
where, as they had delivered,
both in time, form of the thing...

191
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:22,573
each word made true and good,
the apparition comes.

192
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:27,948
I knew your father.
These hands are not more like.

193
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,990
- But where was this?
- Upon the platform where we watch.

194
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:35,740
- Did you not speak to it?
- My lord, I did, but answer made it none.

195
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:40,198
Yet once methought it lifted up its head...

196
00:19:40,573 --> 00:19:43,907
and did address itself to motion,
like as it would speak.

197
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:47,823
But even then
the morning cock crew loud...

198
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:52,157
and at the sound it shrank in haste away
and vanished from our sight.

199
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:56,490
'Tis very strange.

200
00:19:56,657 --> 00:20:01,115
- As I do live, my honored lord, 'tis true.
- Indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.

201
00:20:01,448 --> 00:20:03,948
- Hold you the watch tonight?
- We do, my lord.

202
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:05,657
What, looked he frowningly?

203
00:20:05,657 --> 00:20:07,865
A countenance more in sorrow
than in anger.

204
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,907
- And fixed his eyes upon you?
- Most constantly.

205
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:14,823
- I would I had been there.
- It would have much amazed you.

206
00:20:16,823 --> 00:20:19,823
I will watch tonight.
Perchance it will walk again.

207
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:21,782
I warrant it will.

208
00:20:29,032 --> 00:20:33,823
If you have hitherto concealed this sight,
let it be tenable in your silence still.

209
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:36,198
Our duty to your honor.

210
00:20:36,698 --> 00:20:39,282
Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.

211
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:44,615
My father's spirit.

212
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:47,990
All is not well.

213
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:50,990
I doubt some foul play.

214
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:55,657
Would the night were come.
Till then sit still, my soul.

215
00:20:58,782 --> 00:21:00,657
Foul deeds will rise...

216
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:04,865
though all the earth overwhelm them,
to men's eyes.

217
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:49,823
No jocund health
that Denmark drinks today...

218
00:21:49,948 --> 00:21:53,448
but the great cannon
to the clouds shall tell!

219
00:21:53,615 --> 00:21:55,823
What does this mean, my lord?
Is it a custom?

220
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:57,323
Ay, marry is it.

221
00:21:57,948 --> 00:22:01,698
But to my mind a custom more honored
in the breach than the observance.

222
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:08,740
This heavy-headed revel east and west...

223
00:22:08,823 --> 00:22:11,615
makes us traduced and taxed
of other nations.

224
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:14,115
They clepe us drunkards...

225
00:22:14,198 --> 00:22:17,907
and indeed, it soils the pith and marrow
of our attribute.

226
00:22:42,823 --> 00:22:45,531
The air bites shrewdly. It is very cold.

227
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,531
What hour now?

228
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:53,615
It draws near the season
wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

229
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:13,115
So oft it chances in particular men...

230
00:23:14,698 --> 00:23:17,740
that for some vicious mole of nature
in them...

231
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:21,990
their virtues else,
be they as pure as grace...

232
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:27,115
shall in the general censure
take corruption...

233
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,365
from that particular fault.

234
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,656
Look, my lord, it comes!

235
00:23:54,823 --> 00:23:57,240
Angels and ministers of grace defend us.

236
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:21,073
Be thou a spirit of health
or goblin damned...

237
00:24:21,823 --> 00:24:24,740
bring with thee airs from heaven
or blasts from hell...

238
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:27,448
be thy intents wicked or charitable...

239
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:29,656
I will speak to thee.

240
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:33,115
I'll call thee Hamlet...

241
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:39,073
King, father...

242
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:41,698
royal Dane.

243
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,573
Answer me.

244
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,073
- Do not, my lord.
- Why, what should be the fear?

245
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:10,573
I do not set my life at a pin's fee.

246
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:15,281
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
being a thing immortal as itself?

247
00:25:15,323 --> 00:25:17,781
What if it tempt you toward the flood,
my lord...

248
00:25:17,865 --> 00:25:21,740
or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
that beetles over his base into the sea...

249
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:23,906
and there assume
some other horrible form...

250
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,990
which might deprive your sovereignty
of reason and draw you into madness?

251
00:25:28,115 --> 00:25:29,490
Think of it.

252
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,073
I'll follow it.

253
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:39,115
- You shall not go, my lord!
- Hold off your hands!

254
00:25:39,115 --> 00:25:42,156
By heaven,
I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!

255
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:43,698
I say, away!

256
00:26:02,323 --> 00:26:04,281
Go on, I'll follow thee.

257
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:41,239
- My lord.
- My lord Hamlet!

258
00:26:44,364 --> 00:26:45,489
My lord!

259
00:27:20,781 --> 00:27:22,864
I am thy father's spirit...

260
00:27:24,489 --> 00:27:27,531
doomed for a certain term
to walk the night...

261
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:33,823
and for the day confined to fast in fires.

262
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:40,073
But that I am forbid
to tell the secrets of my prison-house...

263
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:43,239
I could a tale unfold...

264
00:27:43,656 --> 00:27:46,573
whose lightest word
would harrow up thy soul.

265
00:27:50,073 --> 00:27:51,156
List.

266
00:27:58,406 --> 00:28:01,239
If thou didst ever thy dear father love...

267
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:05,823
revenge his foul
and most unnatural murder.

268
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:08,656
Murder?

269
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:12,281
Murder most foul, as in the best it is.

270
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:16,906
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.

271
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,864
'Tis given out...

272
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:24,114
that sleeping in my orchard,
a serpent stung me.

273
00:28:24,823 --> 00:28:26,989
But know, thou noble youth...

274
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:31,906
the serpent that did sting thy father's life
now wears his crown.

275
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:35,948
O my prophetic soul!

276
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:38,489
My uncle.

277
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:42,156
Ay, that incestuous,
that adulterate beast...

278
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:46,448
with witchcraft of his wit,
with traitorous gifts...

279
00:28:46,906 --> 00:28:48,989
won to his shameful lust...

280
00:28:49,073 --> 00:28:52,406
the will
of my most seeming-virtuous queen.

281
00:28:55,031 --> 00:28:56,364
But, soft.

282
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:04,614
Methinks I scent the morning air.

283
00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:09,948
Brief let me be.

284
00:29:11,698 --> 00:29:13,906
Sleeping within my orchard...

285
00:29:14,323 --> 00:29:17,281
my custom always of the afternoon...

286
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:21,573
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole...

287
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:25,864
with juice of cursed hebona in a vial...

288
00:29:26,573 --> 00:29:30,531
and in the porches of mine ears
did pour the leprous distilment.

289
00:29:32,823 --> 00:29:36,531
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand...

290
00:29:37,073 --> 00:29:41,239
of life, of crown, of queen,
at once dispatched...

291
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,947
cut off even in the blossoms of my sin...

292
00:29:48,447 --> 00:29:50,239
no reckoning made...

293
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:55,697
but sent to my account
with all my imperfections on my head.

294
00:29:57,406 --> 00:29:58,739
Oh, horrible!

295
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:06,197
Most horrible.

296
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:12,864
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.

297
00:30:14,197 --> 00:30:16,697
Let not the royal bed of Denmark...

298
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:20,906
be a couch for luxury and damned incest.

299
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:26,781
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act...

300
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:30,614
taint not thy mind...

301
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:36,614
nor let thy soul contrive
against thy mother aught.

302
00:30:38,197 --> 00:30:39,989
Leave her to heaven...

303
00:30:42,531 --> 00:30:47,156
and to those thorns that
in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her.

304
00:30:49,656 --> 00:30:51,656
Fare thee well at once.

305
00:30:53,072 --> 00:30:55,906
The glow-worm
shows the matin to be near...

306
00:30:57,614 --> 00:31:00,739
and begins to pale his uneffectual fire.

307
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:06,614
Adieu.

308
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,781
Remember me.

309
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:41,072
Remember thee?

310
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:47,489
Ay, thou poor ghost...

311
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:53,406
whiles memory holds a seat
in this distracted globe.

312
00:31:54,364 --> 00:31:55,822
Remember thee?

313
00:31:58,697 --> 00:32:01,031
Yea, from the table of my memory...

314
00:32:01,114 --> 00:32:05,114
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records...

315
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:08,239
and thy commandment
all alone shall live...

316
00:32:08,322 --> 00:32:11,072
within the book and volume of my brain...

317
00:32:11,156 --> 00:32:13,406
unmixed with baser matter.

318
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:17,364
Yes, by heaven!

319
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:35,447
O most pernicious woman!

320
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:39,947
O villain!

321
00:32:40,614 --> 00:32:43,781
Villain, smiling, damned villain!

322
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:48,031
My tables, meet it is I set it down.

323
00:32:48,781 --> 00:32:52,114
That one may smile...

324
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:54,322
and smile...

325
00:32:54,864 --> 00:32:58,072
and be a villain!

326
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:08,614
So, uncle...

327
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,572
there you are.

328
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:14,239
Now to my word.

329
00:33:16,322 --> 00:33:20,447
It is, "Adieu, adieu.

330
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:23,239
"Remember me."

331
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,780
I have sworn it.

332
00:33:34,114 --> 00:33:35,405
So be it.

333
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:38,780
Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!

334
00:33:40,989 --> 00:33:43,947
Hillo, ho, ho, boy. Come, bird, come.

335
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,114
What news?

336
00:33:53,739 --> 00:33:57,030
- No, you will reveal it.
- Not I, my lord, by heaven.

337
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,530
There's never a villain dwelling
in all Denmark...

338
00:34:00,614 --> 00:34:02,655
but he's an arrant knave.

339
00:34:04,447 --> 00:34:07,530
There needs no ghost, my lord,
come from the grave, to tell us this.

340
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:10,905
Right, you are in the right.
So I hold it fit we shake hands and part.

341
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,905
These are but wild and whirling words.

342
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,864
I am sorry they offend you, heartily.
Yes, faith, heartily.

343
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:20,364
- There's no offense, my lord.
- There is, Horatio, and much offense, too.

344
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:25,822
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.

345
00:34:28,614 --> 00:34:31,947
And now, good friends,
grant me one poor request.

346
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:34,989
Never make known
what you have seen tonight.

347
00:34:36,822 --> 00:34:38,614
- We will not.
- Upon my sword.

348
00:34:38,697 --> 00:34:40,155
Swear.

349
00:34:47,114 --> 00:34:50,905
Swear by my sword
never to speak of this that you have seen.

350
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:53,322
Never to speak of this
that you have heard.

351
00:34:53,364 --> 00:34:55,572
Swear by his sword.

352
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:58,197
Day and night,
but this is wondrous strange.

353
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,197
And therefore as a stranger
give it welcome.

354
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:04,739
There are more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio...

355
00:35:05,072 --> 00:35:07,655
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

356
00:35:08,655 --> 00:35:09,905
But come!

357
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:16,239
Here, as before, never,
so help you mercy...

358
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:19,739
how strange or odd so ever I bear myself...

359
00:35:19,905 --> 00:35:24,197
as I perchance hereafter shall think meet
to put an antic disposition on...

360
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:27,405
never to note that you know aught of me.

361
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:29,239
This do swear!

362
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:32,572
We swear.

363
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,780
Rest.

364
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:44,030
Rest, perturbed spirit!

365
00:35:51,322 --> 00:35:53,864
The time is out of joint.

366
00:35:53,947 --> 00:35:58,864
O cursed spite,
that ever I was born to set it right.

367
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,614
Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's Day

368
00:36:11,114 --> 00:36:13,614
All in the morning betime

369
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,989
And I a maid

370
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:21,822
At your window

371
00:36:21,905 --> 00:36:24,197
To be your Valentine

372
00:37:50,072 --> 00:37:51,988
- My lord!
- How now?

373
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,322
I think it sure that I have found
the very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

374
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,572
Speak on that, that I do long to hear.

375
00:38:04,822 --> 00:38:06,613
My liege, and madam...

376
00:38:06,822 --> 00:38:10,780
to expostulate what majesty should be,
what duty is...

377
00:38:10,863 --> 00:38:14,072
why day is day, night night,
and time is time...

378
00:38:14,822 --> 00:38:17,738
were nothing but to waste night,
day, and time.

379
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,530
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
I will be brief.

380
00:38:24,947 --> 00:38:27,738
Your noble son is mad.

381
00:38:29,613 --> 00:38:31,405
Mad call I it...

382
00:38:31,488 --> 00:38:34,905
for, to define true madness,
what is it but to be nothing else but mad?

383
00:38:34,988 --> 00:38:37,780
- But let that go.
- More matter, with less art.

384
00:38:37,863 --> 00:38:40,530
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.

385
00:38:40,572 --> 00:38:43,488
That he is mad, 'tis pity, 'tis true.

386
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:46,030
'Tis true 'tis pity, and pity 'tis 'tis true.

387
00:38:46,155 --> 00:38:49,697
A foolish figure, but farewell it,
for I will use no art.

388
00:38:50,322 --> 00:38:52,447
Mad let us grant him, then.

389
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:55,530
And now remains...

390
00:38:55,905 --> 00:38:58,905
that we find out the cause of this effect.

391
00:39:03,363 --> 00:39:05,988
Or rather say, the cause of this defect...

392
00:39:05,988 --> 00:39:09,322
for this effect defective comes by cause.

393
00:39:09,405 --> 00:39:13,155
Thus it remains,
and the remainder thus. Perpend.

394
00:39:22,197 --> 00:39:26,030
I have a daughter,
have while she is mine...

395
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:31,197
who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
hath given me this.

396
00:39:31,822 --> 00:39:33,738
Now, gather and surmise.

397
00:39:37,405 --> 00:39:39,155
"To the celestial...

398
00:39:39,405 --> 00:39:42,697
"and my soul's idol,
the most beautified Ophelia."

399
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,905
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase.
"Beautified" is a vile phrase.

400
00:39:47,988 --> 00:39:49,738
But you shall hear.

401
00:39:50,405 --> 00:39:52,280
Came this from Hamlet to her?

402
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,572
Good madam, stay awhile.
I will be faithful.

403
00:39:56,613 --> 00:39:59,530
"Doubt thou the stars are fire.

404
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:02,780
"Doubt that the sun doth move.

405
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:06,030
"Doubt truth to be a liar.

406
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,947
"But never doubt I love.

407
00:40:10,405 --> 00:40:12,738
"Thine evermore, most dear lady...

408
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:16,405
"whilst this machine is to him, Hamlet."

409
00:40:17,113 --> 00:40:19,321
This in obedience
hath my daughter shown me.

410
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:21,821
But how hath she received his love?

411
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:31,113
- What do you think of me?
- As of a man faithful and honorable.

412
00:40:31,238 --> 00:40:35,196
I would fain prove so. And
my young mistress thus I did bespeak...

413
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:38,030
that she should lock herself
from his resort.

414
00:40:38,113 --> 00:40:40,946
Thus he repelled, a short tale to make...

415
00:40:41,363 --> 00:40:44,530
fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
thence to a lightness...

416
00:40:44,571 --> 00:40:47,696
and by this declension
into the madness wherein now he raves...

417
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,613
and all we mourn for.

418
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:57,196
Hath there been such a time,
I would fain know that...

419
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,446
that I have positively said,
"'Tis so," when it proved otherwise?

420
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:04,321
- Not that I know.
- Take this from this, if this be otherwise.

421
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:10,613
How may we try it further?

422
00:41:10,905 --> 00:41:14,155
You know, sometimes he walks
four hours together here in the lobby.

423
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,363
So he does indeed.

424
00:41:15,446 --> 00:41:17,613
At such a time,
I'll loose my daughter to him.

425
00:41:17,696 --> 00:41:21,155
Be you and I behind an arras then.
Mark the encounter.

426
00:41:21,238 --> 00:41:24,655
If he love her not, and be not
from his reason fallen thereon...

427
00:41:25,155 --> 00:41:27,613
let me be no assistant for a state.

428
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:30,696
But look where sadly
the poor wretch comes reading.

429
00:41:35,155 --> 00:41:37,113
I'll board him presently.

430
00:41:40,905 --> 00:41:42,530
Do you think 'tis this?

431
00:41:45,071 --> 00:41:47,655
I doubt it is no other but the main.

432
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:52,196
His father's death,
and our overhasty marriage.

433
00:42:14,196 --> 00:42:16,155
Do you know me, my lord?

434
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:19,363
Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.

435
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:24,946
- Not I, my lord.
- Then I would you were so honest a man.

436
00:42:26,196 --> 00:42:27,530
Honest, my lord?

437
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:32,113
To be honest, as this world goes,
is to be one man picked out of 10,000.

438
00:42:32,238 --> 00:42:34,530
For if the sun breed maggots
in a dead dog...

439
00:42:34,613 --> 00:42:36,821
being a good kissing carrion...

440
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:41,030
- Have you a daughter?
- I have, my lord.

441
00:42:41,738 --> 00:42:43,488
Let her not walk in the sun.

442
00:42:43,905 --> 00:42:47,696
Conception is a blessing,
but as your daughter may conceive...

443
00:42:47,738 --> 00:42:49,905
Friend, look to it.

444
00:42:57,863 --> 00:42:59,780
Still harping on my daughter.

445
00:43:03,405 --> 00:43:05,446
What do you read, my lord?

446
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:08,988
Words.

447
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,905
What is the matter, my lord?

448
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,946
- Between who?
- The matter that you read.

449
00:43:25,863 --> 00:43:27,405
Slanders, sir.

450
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:32,863
For the satirical rogue says here
that old men have gray beards...

451
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:34,738
their faces are wrinkled...

452
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:38,030
their eyes purging thick amber
and plum-tree gum...

453
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:44,279
and that they have a plentiful lack of wit,
together with most weak hams.

454
00:43:44,363 --> 00:43:46,696
How pregnant sometimes his replies are.

455
00:43:46,821 --> 00:43:50,488
All of which, sir, I most powerfully
and potently believe...

456
00:43:50,904 --> 00:43:54,238
yet I hold it not honesty
to have it thus set down.

457
00:43:54,571 --> 00:43:59,196
For you yourself shall be old as I am,
if, like a crab, you could go backward.

458
00:44:00,446 --> 00:44:01,654
My lord!

459
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:10,571
My honorable lord,
I will most humbly take my leave.

460
00:44:10,696 --> 00:44:13,363
You cannot, sir, take from me anything...

461
00:44:13,446 --> 00:44:16,113
that I will more willingly part withal.

462
00:44:18,196 --> 00:44:19,696
Except my life.

463
00:44:42,363 --> 00:44:46,321
Ophelia, I do wish
that your good beauties...

464
00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:49,279
be the happy cause of Hamlet's wildness.

465
00:44:50,113 --> 00:44:54,321
So shall I hope your virtues
will bring him to his wonted way again...

466
00:44:54,613 --> 00:44:56,363
to both your honors.

467
00:44:57,988 --> 00:44:59,779
Madam, I wish it may.

468
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,988
Ophelia, walk you here.

469
00:45:18,154 --> 00:45:21,321
Gracious, so please you,
we will bestow ourselves.

470
00:45:21,988 --> 00:45:23,696
Read on this book.

471
00:45:25,446 --> 00:45:28,154
He is coming. Let us withdraw, my lord.

472
00:45:48,196 --> 00:45:51,988
Nymph, in thy orisons
be all my sins remembered.

473
00:45:53,238 --> 00:45:54,696
Good my lord...

474
00:45:55,529 --> 00:45:57,863
how does your honor for this many a day?

475
00:45:57,946 --> 00:45:59,904
I humbly thank you, well.

476
00:46:00,821 --> 00:46:03,529
My lord, I have remembrances of yours...

477
00:46:05,779 --> 00:46:08,363
that I have longed long to redeliver.

478
00:46:09,654 --> 00:46:11,446
I pray you now, receive them.

479
00:46:11,571 --> 00:46:13,946
No, not I. I never gave you aught.

480
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:17,863
My honored lord,
you know right well you did.

481
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:21,779
And with them
words of so sweet breath composed...

482
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,071
as made the things more rich.

483
00:46:28,904 --> 00:46:31,738
Their perfume lost, take these again.

484
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:36,779
There, my lord.

485
00:46:44,238 --> 00:46:46,779
- Are you honest?
- My lord?

486
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:50,029
- Are you fair?
- What means your lordship?

487
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:52,654
That if you be honest and fair...

488
00:46:52,738 --> 00:46:56,196
your honesty should admit
no discourse to your beauty.

489
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:01,113
Could beauty, my lord,
have better commerce than with honesty?

490
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:04,988
I did love you once.

491
00:47:06,113 --> 00:47:08,988
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

492
00:47:10,571 --> 00:47:13,779
You should not have believed me.
I loved you not!

493
00:47:15,237 --> 00:47:16,987
Where's your father?

494
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:20,946
At home, my lord.

495
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:25,321
Let the doors be shut upon him...

496
00:47:25,404 --> 00:47:28,821
that he may play the fool nowhere
but in his own house!

497
00:47:29,362 --> 00:47:32,946
If thou dost marry,
I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry.

498
00:47:32,987 --> 00:47:36,237
Be thou as chaste as ice,
as pure as snow...

499
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:38,529
thou shalt not escape calumny!

500
00:47:38,737 --> 00:47:41,112
Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool...

501
00:47:41,237 --> 00:47:44,946
for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them.

502
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,904
I have heard of your paintings
well enough.

503
00:47:48,029 --> 00:47:51,654
God hath given you one face
and you make yourselves another.

504
00:47:51,862 --> 00:47:55,487
You jig and amble, and you lisp.
You nickname God's creatures...

505
00:47:55,529 --> 00:47:57,904
and make your wantonness
your ignorance.

506
00:47:57,987 --> 00:48:02,279
Go to! I'll no more on it.
It hath made me mad!

507
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:06,404
I say we will have no more marriage.

508
00:48:08,737 --> 00:48:12,362
Those that are married already,
all but one, shall live.

509
00:48:12,862 --> 00:48:15,446
The rest shall keep as they are.

510
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:33,071
We must watch him,
and that most carefully.

511
00:48:38,404 --> 00:48:41,446
I have in quick determination
thus set it down:

512
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:47,487
He shall with speed to England,
for the demand of our neglected tribute.

513
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:52,487
Haply the seas and countries
different with variable objects...

514
00:48:52,612 --> 00:48:56,779
shall expel this something-settled matter
in his heart.

515
00:49:06,279 --> 00:49:10,529
Madness in great ones
must not unwatched go.

516
00:49:35,862 --> 00:49:38,696
To be, or not to be. That is the question.

517
00:49:41,987 --> 00:49:46,404
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer the slings and arrows...

518
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:48,446
of outrageous fortune...

519
00:49:52,154 --> 00:49:55,071
or to take arms against a sea of troubles...

520
00:49:57,362 --> 00:50:00,237
and by opposing end them?

521
00:50:02,821 --> 00:50:04,154
To die...

522
00:50:07,362 --> 00:50:10,446
to sleep no more.

523
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:19,779
And, by a sleep to say
we end the heartache...

524
00:50:19,987 --> 00:50:23,862
and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to...

525
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:28,612
'tis a consummation...

526
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:32,154
devoutly to be wished.

527
00:50:35,487 --> 00:50:36,737
To die...

528
00:50:38,987 --> 00:50:40,279
to sleep.

529
00:50:46,654 --> 00:50:48,987
To sleep, perchance to dream.

530
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,112
Ay, there's the rub.

531
00:50:54,529 --> 00:50:58,362
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come...

532
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:02,320
when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil...

533
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:04,112
must give us pause.

534
00:51:04,154 --> 00:51:06,237
There's the respect...

535
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,237
that makes calamity of so long life.

536
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,987
For who would bear
the whips and scorns of time...

537
00:51:18,654 --> 00:51:22,320
the oppressor's wrong,
the proud man's contumely...

538
00:51:23,695 --> 00:51:26,904
the pangs of disprized love,
the law's delay...

539
00:51:26,945 --> 00:51:29,779
the insolence of office, and the spurns...

540
00:51:30,362 --> 00:51:34,112
that patient merit of the unworthy takes...

541
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:42,987
when he himself might his quietus make...

542
00:51:45,029 --> 00:51:47,029
with a bare bodkin?

543
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,279
Who would fardels bear...

544
00:51:58,779 --> 00:52:02,820
to grunt and sweat under a weary life...

545
00:52:04,487 --> 00:52:07,945
but that the dread
of something after death...

546
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:12,112
the undiscovered country...

547
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:16,487
from whose bourn no traveler returns...

548
00:52:16,945 --> 00:52:18,695
puzzles the will...

549
00:52:20,112 --> 00:52:24,279
and makes us
rather bear those ills we have...

550
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,112
than fly to others that we know not of?

551
00:52:32,404 --> 00:52:36,695
Thus conscience
does make cowards of us all...

552
00:52:38,695 --> 00:52:42,320
and thus the native hue of resolution...

553
00:52:42,404 --> 00:52:46,029
is sicklied over
with the pale cast of thought...

554
00:52:48,029 --> 00:52:51,112
and enterprises of great pitch
and moment...

555
00:52:52,154 --> 00:52:56,279
with this regard their currents turn awry...

556
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:01,987
and lose the name of action.

557
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:49,404
- My honored lord.
- My most dear lord.

558
00:53:53,237 --> 00:53:55,279
My excellent good friends.

559
00:53:56,195 --> 00:54:00,070
How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Rosencrantz?

560
00:54:01,779 --> 00:54:03,904
Good lads, how do you both?

561
00:54:07,487 --> 00:54:10,612
What have you, my good friends,
deserved at the hands of fortune...

562
00:54:10,695 --> 00:54:12,528
that she sends you to prison hither?

563
00:54:12,653 --> 00:54:15,237
- Prison, my lord?
- Denmark's a prison.

564
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,570
We think not so, my lord.

565
00:54:18,278 --> 00:54:19,945
Why, then, 'tis none to you...

566
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,403
for there is nothing good or bad
but thinking makes it so.

567
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,445
To me it is a prison.

568
00:54:25,945 --> 00:54:29,278
Why, then your ambition makes it one.
It is too narrow for your mind.

569
00:54:29,362 --> 00:54:30,612
Oh, God.

570
00:54:30,695 --> 00:54:35,445
I could be bounded in a nutshell,
and count myself a king of infinite space...

571
00:54:36,362 --> 00:54:40,903
- were it not that I have had bad dreams.
- Which dreams, indeed, are ambition...

572
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:45,528
for the very substance of the ambitious
is merely the shadow of a dream.

573
00:54:47,487 --> 00:54:50,570
Shall we away?
For, by my fay, I cannot reason.

574
00:55:17,112 --> 00:55:19,153
What make you at Elsinore?

575
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:22,320
To visit you, my lord. No other occasion.

576
00:55:25,112 --> 00:55:28,112
Beggar that I am,
I am even poor in thanks.

577
00:55:29,362 --> 00:55:32,570
But, my dear friends,
were you not sent for?

578
00:55:36,737 --> 00:55:38,737
Is it your own inclining?

579
00:55:41,653 --> 00:55:43,612
Is it a free visitation?

580
00:55:44,862 --> 00:55:48,778
Come, come, deal justly with me.
Come, come. Nay, speak.

581
00:55:49,945 --> 00:55:53,070
- What should we say?
- Why, anything, but to the purpose.

582
00:55:53,112 --> 00:55:56,070
There is a kind of confession in your looks.

583
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,820
I know the good King and Queen
have sent for you.

584
00:56:02,862 --> 00:56:04,278
To what end?

585
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,278
That you must teach me.

586
00:56:11,195 --> 00:56:14,903
Be even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for or no!

587
00:56:15,112 --> 00:56:17,903
My lord, we were sent for.

588
00:56:20,362 --> 00:56:22,112
I will tell you why.

589
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,945
So shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery...

590
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:30,528
and your secrecy to the king and queen
molt no feather.

591
00:56:37,237 --> 00:56:41,945
I have of late, but wherefore I know not,
lost all my mirth...

592
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,945
forgone all custom of exercises.

593
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,070
And indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition...

594
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:52,987
that this goodly frame, the earth...

595
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:57,278
seems to me a sterile promontory.

596
00:57:00,362 --> 00:57:03,195
This most excellent canopy,
the air, look you...

597
00:57:03,237 --> 00:57:05,695
this brave overhanging firmament...

598
00:57:06,028 --> 00:57:09,153
this majestical roof
fretted with golden fire...

599
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,445
Why, it appeareth nothing to me...

600
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:16,403
but a foul and pestilent
congregation of vapors.

601
00:57:31,737 --> 00:57:34,070
What a piece of work is a man.

602
00:57:35,903 --> 00:57:37,820
How noble in reason.

603
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:40,695
How infinite in faculties.

604
00:57:40,903 --> 00:57:44,153
In form and moving,
how express and admirable.

605
00:57:45,986 --> 00:57:49,861
In action, how like an angel,
in apprehension, how like a god.

606
00:57:50,611 --> 00:57:53,861
The beauty of the world,
the paragon of animals.

607
00:57:55,528 --> 00:57:57,153
And yet, to me...

608
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:00,445
what is this quintessence of dust?

609
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,736
Man delights not me.

610
00:58:07,278 --> 00:58:09,278
No, nor woman neither...

611
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:11,278
though, by your smiling,
you seem to say so.

612
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,028
- There was no such stuff in my thoughts.
- Why laugh then...

613
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:17,736
- when I said, "Man delights not me"?
- To think, if you delight not in man...

614
00:58:17,778 --> 00:58:21,070
what Lenten entertainment
the players shall receive.

615
00:58:35,653 --> 00:58:38,195
Just the same as ever before. Come on.

616
00:58:38,403 --> 00:58:40,028
Boys, take the horses.

617
00:58:40,861 --> 00:58:42,028
Out of the way!

618
00:58:46,945 --> 00:58:49,528
Masters, you are welcome to Elsinore.

619
00:59:30,236 --> 00:59:32,945
Good my lord,
will you see the players well bestowed?

620
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:35,861
For they are the abstract
and brief chronicles of the time.

621
00:59:35,903 --> 00:59:38,403
After your death
you were better have a bad epitaph...

622
00:59:38,445 --> 00:59:41,028
than their ill report while you live.

623
00:59:41,236 --> 00:59:45,903
- I shall use them according to their desert.
- God's bodkins, man, much better.

624
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,736
Use every man after his desert,
and who shall escape whipping?

625
00:59:53,486 --> 00:59:54,945
Take them in.

626
00:59:55,611 --> 00:59:57,403
Follow him, friends.

627
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,361
We'll hear a play tomorrow.

628
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:12,736
My lord Hamlet!

629
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:17,111
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.

630
01:00:17,195 --> 01:00:20,195
But my uncle-father and aunt-mother
are deceived.

631
01:00:20,236 --> 01:00:22,111
In what, my dear lord?

632
01:00:22,236 --> 01:00:24,445
I am but mad north-north-west.

633
01:00:25,236 --> 01:00:29,570
When the wind is southerly
I know a hawk from a handsaw.

634
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:57,153
Am I a coward?

635
01:00:58,403 --> 01:01:01,986
'Swounds, it cannot be
but I am pigeon-livered...

636
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:04,653
and lack gall to make oppression bitter...

637
01:01:04,736 --> 01:01:08,320
or ere this I should have fatted
all the region kites...

638
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:10,278
with this slave's offal!

639
01:01:10,736 --> 01:01:12,653
Bloody, bawdy villain!

640
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:18,028
Remorseless, treacherous,
lecherous, kindless villain!

641
01:01:19,236 --> 01:01:21,944
O vengeance!

642
01:01:26,611 --> 01:01:28,486
Why, what an ass am I.

643
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:31,278
This is most brave...

644
01:01:32,403 --> 01:01:35,361
that I, the son of a dear father murdered...

645
01:01:35,861 --> 01:01:39,236
prompted to my revenge
by heaven and hell...

646
01:01:39,861 --> 01:01:44,069
must, like a whore,
unpack my heart with words...

647
01:01:47,653 --> 01:01:52,569
and fall a-cursing
like a very drab, a scullion!

648
01:01:53,528 --> 01:01:55,736
Fie! Foh!

649
01:01:56,569 --> 01:01:58,694
About, my brains.

650
01:02:09,736 --> 01:02:11,319
Give me that.

651
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:13,403
It's heavy!

652
01:02:23,194 --> 01:02:26,819
I have heard
that guilty creatures sitting at a play...

653
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:31,903
have by the very cunning of the scene
been struck so to the soul...

654
01:02:32,403 --> 01:02:35,861
that presently they have proclaimed
their malefactions.

655
01:02:37,069 --> 01:02:40,403
I'll have these players play something
like the murder of my father...

656
01:02:40,486 --> 01:02:41,736
before mine uncle.

657
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:45,153
I'll observe his looks.
I'll tent him to the quick.

658
01:02:45,778 --> 01:02:48,944
If he do blench, I know my course.

659
01:02:51,111 --> 01:02:53,736
The spirit that I have seen may be a devil...

660
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:57,194
and the devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape, yea.

661
01:02:57,569 --> 01:02:59,861
And perhaps out of my weakness
and my melancholy...

662
01:02:59,903 --> 01:03:03,861
as he is very potent with such spirits,
abuses me to damn me.

663
01:03:05,278 --> 01:03:08,111
I'll have grounds more relative than this.

664
01:03:12,611 --> 01:03:14,528
The play's the thing...

665
01:03:14,653 --> 01:03:17,403
wherein I'll catch
the conscience of the king.

666
01:03:20,778 --> 01:03:23,236
'Tis almost the time, my friends.

667
01:03:27,736 --> 01:03:29,028
Haste you!

668
01:03:33,444 --> 01:03:34,861
Observe my uncle.

669
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:38,778
If his occulted guilt
do not itself unkennel in one speech...

670
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:43,653
it is a damned ghost that we have seen,
and my imaginations all are foul.

671
01:03:44,903 --> 01:03:48,528
- I must be idle. Get you a place.
- Well, my lord.

672
01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:12,486
These are the best actors in the world...

673
01:04:14,528 --> 01:04:18,403
either for tragedy, comedy, history...

674
01:04:18,569 --> 01:04:22,861
pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral...

675
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:26,236
tragical-historical...

676
01:04:26,569 --> 01:04:29,153
tragical-comical-historical-pastoral.

677
01:04:30,736 --> 01:04:34,319
For the law of writ and the liberty...

678
01:04:34,778 --> 01:04:37,444
these are the only men.

679
01:04:42,944 --> 01:04:45,736
My lord, you played once
for the university, you say?

680
01:04:45,819 --> 01:04:49,194
That did I, my lord,
and was accounted a good actor.

681
01:04:49,236 --> 01:04:51,027
What did you enact?

682
01:04:52,194 --> 01:04:54,486
I did enact Julius Caesar.

683
01:04:56,069 --> 01:04:59,027
I was killed in the Capitol.
Brutus killed me.

684
01:04:59,152 --> 01:05:02,527
It was a brute part of him
to kill so capital a calf there.

685
01:05:03,527 --> 01:05:05,444
How fares our cousin Hamlet?

686
01:05:05,486 --> 01:05:08,444
Excellent, in faith, of the chameleon's dish.

687
01:05:08,611 --> 01:05:11,277
I eat the air, promise-crammed.

688
01:05:12,194 --> 01:05:14,861
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

689
01:05:17,027 --> 01:05:20,027
No, good mother,
here's metal more attractive.

690
01:05:22,402 --> 01:05:25,361
- Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
- No, my lord.

691
01:05:25,861 --> 01:05:28,111
I mean, my head upon your lap?

692
01:05:30,569 --> 01:05:34,319
- Ay, my lord.
- Do you think I meant country matters?

693
01:05:36,569 --> 01:05:38,569
I think nothing, my lord.

694
01:05:38,736 --> 01:05:41,402
That's a fair thought
to lie between maids' legs.

695
01:05:41,486 --> 01:05:43,569
- What is, my lord?
- Nothing.

696
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:48,944
- You are merry, my lord.
- Who, I?

697
01:05:49,027 --> 01:05:51,152
- Ay, my lord.
- Oh, God.

698
01:05:51,944 --> 01:05:54,444
What should a man do but be merry?

699
01:05:54,902 --> 01:05:57,486
For, look you,
how cheerfully my mother looks...

700
01:05:57,527 --> 01:06:00,152
and my father died within's two hours.

701
01:06:00,444 --> 01:06:03,027
Nay, it is twice two months, my lord.

702
01:06:03,361 --> 01:06:04,569
So long?

703
01:06:05,152 --> 01:06:09,236
O heavens, die two months ago,
and not forgotten yet?

704
01:06:10,277 --> 01:06:13,527
There's hope a great man's memory
may outlive his life half a year.

705
01:06:44,277 --> 01:06:48,902
Get thee to a nunnery.
Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?

706
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:56,944
I am myself indifferent honest,
but yet I could accuse me of such things...

707
01:06:57,069 --> 01:06:59,069
it were better
my mother had not borne me.

708
01:07:03,236 --> 01:07:07,861
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious,
with more offenses at my beck...

709
01:07:07,944 --> 01:07:11,361
than I have thoughts to put them in,
imagination to give them shape...

710
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,319
or time to act them in.

711
01:07:15,402 --> 01:07:19,486
What should such fellows as I do
crawling between earth and heaven?

712
01:07:23,152 --> 01:07:24,861
Believe none of us.

713
01:07:37,402 --> 01:07:40,194
For us, for our tragedy...

714
01:07:41,486 --> 01:07:44,944
here stooping to your clemency...

715
01:07:46,027 --> 01:07:49,819
we beg your hearing patiently.

716
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:57,736
- Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
- Indeed, 'tis brief, my son.

717
01:07:57,819 --> 01:07:59,402
As woman's love.

718
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,944
'Tis 30 years since Hymen
did our hands unite commutual...

719
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:19,819
in most sacred bands.

720
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:27,194
So many journeys
may the sun and moon...

721
01:08:27,277 --> 01:08:30,527
make us again count over
ere love be done.

722
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:37,235
But should I die before a new sun shine...

723
01:08:37,527 --> 01:08:40,194
you might another husband soon entwine.

724
01:08:40,527 --> 01:08:43,277
Nay, should you die...

725
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:45,902
I should confound the rest!

726
01:08:46,402 --> 01:08:49,735
Such love must needs be treason
in my breast.

727
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,819
In second husband let me be accurst.

728
01:08:54,069 --> 01:08:57,860
None wed the second
but who killed the first.

729
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:01,819
Wormwood.

730
01:09:01,902 --> 01:09:04,735
I do believe you think
what now you speak.

731
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:08,110
But what we do determine, oft we break.

732
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:11,860
This world is not for aye,
nor is it strange...

733
01:09:12,027 --> 01:09:16,485
that even our loves
should with our fortunes change.

734
01:09:27,402 --> 01:09:29,485
If she should break it now.

735
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:36,985
Both here and hence
pursue me lasting strife...

736
01:09:37,735 --> 01:09:41,777
if, once a widow, ever I be wife.

737
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:45,152
Madam, how like you this play?

738
01:09:45,402 --> 01:09:48,110
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.

739
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:51,902
- But she'll keep her word.
- Have you heard the argument?

740
01:09:52,902 --> 01:09:56,777
- Is there no offense in it?
- No, they do but jest...

741
01:09:57,152 --> 01:09:59,944
poison in jest. No offense in the world.

742
01:10:02,027 --> 01:10:04,902
- What do you call the play?
- The Mousetrap.

743
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:08,819
'Tis a knavish piece of work,
but what of that?

744
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:12,319
Your majesty and I have free souls,
it touches us not.

745
01:10:20,402 --> 01:10:23,194
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.

746
01:10:23,277 --> 01:10:26,985
- You are as good as a chorus, Cousin.
- His name is Gonzago.

747
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:33,569
Wait, you shall see anon...

748
01:10:33,735 --> 01:10:36,860
how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.

749
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:03,985
How fares my lord?

750
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,985
Give me some...

751
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,693
Give me some light!

752
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:20,985
Lights! Give over the play!

753
01:12:30,735 --> 01:12:33,693
What, frighted with false fire?

754
01:12:34,985 --> 01:12:37,860
Why, let the stricken deer go weep!

755
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:47,318
Why, let the stricken deer go weep

756
01:12:47,652 --> 01:12:50,360
The hart ungalled play

757
01:12:50,443 --> 01:12:54,110
For some must watch
while some must sleep

758
01:12:54,318 --> 01:12:58,277
Thus runs the world away

759
01:12:59,318 --> 01:13:00,818
O good Horatio...

760
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:03,860
I'll take the ghost's word
for a thousand pound. Didst perceive?

761
01:13:03,985 --> 01:13:05,985
- Very well.
- Upon the talk of the poisoning?

762
01:13:06,027 --> 01:13:07,735
I did very well...

763
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:14,610
Believe none of us.
We are arrant knaves, all.

764
01:13:17,152 --> 01:13:19,610
To a nunnery, go. And quickly, too.

765
01:13:24,568 --> 01:13:25,735
Farewell.

766
01:13:34,985 --> 01:13:37,318
Good my lord,
vouchsafe me a word with you.

767
01:13:37,402 --> 01:13:39,318
- Sir, a whole history.
- The King, sir.

768
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,402
Ay, sir, what of him?

769
01:13:40,485 --> 01:13:42,318
Is in his retirement
marvelous distempered.

770
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,568
- With drink, sir?
- No, my lord, rather with choler.

771
01:13:45,652 --> 01:13:49,110
Your wisdom should show itself
more richer to signify this to the doctor.

772
01:13:49,152 --> 01:13:52,610
Put your discourse into some frame,
and make me a wholesome answer.

773
01:13:52,652 --> 01:13:54,735
- Sir, I cannot.
- What, my lord?

774
01:13:54,818 --> 01:13:57,485
Make you a wholesome answer.
My wit's diseased.

775
01:13:57,568 --> 01:14:00,693
- The Queen, your mother, sent us to you.
- You are welcome.

776
01:14:00,777 --> 01:14:03,152
Your behavior hath struck her
into amazement.

777
01:14:03,193 --> 01:14:05,985
O wonderful son,
that can so astonish a mother!

778
01:14:06,068 --> 01:14:09,985
My lord, what is your cause of distemper?

779
01:14:10,485 --> 01:14:12,777
You do surely bar the door
upon your own liberty...

780
01:14:12,818 --> 01:14:15,527
if you deny your griefs to your friend.

781
01:14:17,568 --> 01:14:19,735
Will you play upon this pipe?

782
01:14:20,568 --> 01:14:22,235
I cannot, my lord.

783
01:14:22,985 --> 01:14:26,068
I do beseech you.
Come, it is as easy as lying.

784
01:14:28,235 --> 01:14:30,027
I have not the skill.

785
01:14:31,152 --> 01:14:34,568
Why, look you now,
how unworthy a thing you make of me!

786
01:14:34,652 --> 01:14:35,985
You would play upon me.

787
01:14:36,068 --> 01:14:38,610
You would pluck out
the heart of my mystery...

788
01:14:38,693 --> 01:14:42,152
sound me from my lowest note
to the top of my compass.

789
01:14:42,318 --> 01:14:46,943
God's blood, do you think
I am easier to be played on than a pipe?

790
01:14:50,818 --> 01:14:53,318
I will come to my mother by and by.

791
01:14:53,818 --> 01:14:56,735
- We will say so.
- "By and by" is easily said.

792
01:15:07,901 --> 01:15:10,901
'Tis now the very witching time of night...

793
01:15:12,776 --> 01:15:14,651
when churchyards yawn...

794
01:15:14,735 --> 01:15:19,068
and hell itself
breathes out contagion to this world.

795
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:25,943
Now could I drink hot blood...

796
01:15:27,151 --> 01:15:32,068
and do such bitter business
as the day would quake to look on.

797
01:15:35,901 --> 01:15:37,776
Soft, now to my mother.

798
01:15:39,443 --> 01:15:42,901
My offense is rank, it smells to heaven.

799
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,151
It hath the primal eldest curse upon it.

800
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,110
A brother's murder.

801
01:16:07,235 --> 01:16:10,735
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying.
And now I'll do it.

802
01:16:10,818 --> 01:16:14,151
And so he goes to heaven,
and so am I revenged.

803
01:16:15,026 --> 01:16:16,901
That would be scanned.

804
01:16:18,151 --> 01:16:19,651
A villain kills my father.

805
01:16:19,735 --> 01:16:23,651
And for that I, his sole son,
do this same villain send to heaven...

806
01:16:24,943 --> 01:16:27,818
when he is fit
and seasoned for his passage.

807
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:32,026
Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge.

808
01:16:36,818 --> 01:16:38,526
O wretched state!

809
01:16:40,568 --> 01:16:43,235
O bosom black as death!

810
01:16:45,235 --> 01:16:48,610
No. When he is drunk asleep,
or in his rage...

811
01:16:48,651 --> 01:16:51,276
or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed...

812
01:16:51,318 --> 01:16:54,151
then trip him,
that his heels may kick at heaven...

813
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:58,485
and that his soul may be as damned
and black as hell, whereto it goes.

814
01:16:59,485 --> 01:17:00,860
Now to my mother.

815
01:17:03,568 --> 01:17:07,485
'Tis meet that some more audience
than a mother should overhear.

816
01:17:07,985 --> 01:17:10,943
- Mother!
- Withdraw, I hear him coming.

817
01:17:14,985 --> 01:17:16,110
Mother.

818
01:17:19,443 --> 01:17:22,276
- Pray you, be round with him.
- Fear me not.

819
01:17:33,943 --> 01:17:35,860
Now, Mother, what's the matter?

820
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:40,401
Hamlet, thou hast thy father
much offended.

821
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,610
Mother, you have my father
much offended.

822
01:17:43,651 --> 01:17:46,776
Come, come,
you answer with an idle tongue.

823
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:48,818
Go, go,
you question with a wicked tongue.

824
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,818
Why, how now, Hamlet?

825
01:17:51,985 --> 01:17:54,901
- What's the matter now?
- Have you forgot me?

826
01:17:54,985 --> 01:17:56,693
No, by the rood, not so.

827
01:17:56,776 --> 01:17:59,110
You are the Queen,
your husband's brother's wife.

828
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:01,276
And, would it were not so,
you are my mother.

829
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,110
Nay then, I'll set those to you
that can speak.

830
01:18:09,235 --> 01:18:10,276
Come.

831
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:14,110
Come and sit you down.
You shall not budge.

832
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,360
You go not till I set you up a glass...

833
01:18:18,526 --> 01:18:21,401
where you may see the inmost part of you.

834
01:18:21,485 --> 01:18:24,193
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me?

835
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,318
- Help!
- Help!

836
01:18:26,985 --> 01:18:29,610
How now! A rat? Dead, for a ducat!

837
01:18:31,651 --> 01:18:32,610
Dead!

838
01:18:33,026 --> 01:18:37,526
- O me, what hast thou done?
- Nay, I know not. Is it the king?

839
01:18:54,776 --> 01:18:58,109
What a rash and bloody deed is this!

840
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:01,776
A bloody deed.
Almost as bad, good mother...

841
01:19:01,859 --> 01:19:04,276
as kill a king and marry with his brother.

842
01:19:04,318 --> 01:19:07,401
- As kill a king?
- Aye, lady, it was my word.

843
01:19:11,318 --> 01:19:15,526
Thou wretched, rash,
intruding fool, farewell.

844
01:19:17,109 --> 01:19:19,276
I took thee for thy better.

845
01:19:20,818 --> 01:19:22,526
Take thy fortune.

846
01:19:22,609 --> 01:19:25,484
Thou findest to be too busy
is some danger.

847
01:19:29,526 --> 01:19:31,693
Leave wringing of your hands.

848
01:19:34,359 --> 01:19:38,651
Peace, sit you down,
and let me wring your heart.

849
01:19:38,693 --> 01:19:43,109
For so I shall,
if it be made of penetrable stuff.

850
01:19:46,651 --> 01:19:50,359
What have I done, that thou darest wag
thy tongue in noise so rude against me?

851
01:19:50,443 --> 01:19:55,318
Such an act that blurs
the grace and blush of modesty...

852
01:19:55,984 --> 01:19:57,901
calls virtue hypocrite...

853
01:19:57,984 --> 01:20:00,943
makes marriage vows
as false as dicers' oaths.

854
01:20:01,026 --> 01:20:02,568
Ay me, what act?

855
01:20:11,068 --> 01:20:13,943
Look here, upon this picture, and on this.

856
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:17,859
The counterfeit presentment
of two brothers.

857
01:20:21,109 --> 01:20:24,568
See, what a grace
was seated on this brow.

858
01:20:25,568 --> 01:20:28,068
A combination and a form indeed...

859
01:20:28,109 --> 01:20:31,443
where every god did seem to set his seal...

860
01:20:31,651 --> 01:20:34,234
to give the world assurance of a man.

861
01:20:35,943 --> 01:20:38,234
This was your husband.

862
01:20:38,984 --> 01:20:42,234
Look you now, what follows.
Here is your husband...

863
01:20:42,443 --> 01:20:45,776
like a mildewed ear,
blasting his wholesome brother.

864
01:20:45,818 --> 01:20:47,234
Have you eyes?

865
01:20:47,276 --> 01:20:50,568
Could you, on this fair mountain,
leave to feed...

866
01:20:50,609 --> 01:20:52,609
and batten on this moor?

867
01:20:53,568 --> 01:20:56,984
Have you eyes? You cannot call it love...

868
01:20:57,359 --> 01:21:00,234
for at your age,
the heyday in the blood is tame...

869
01:21:00,276 --> 01:21:03,151
it's humble, and waits upon the judgment.

870
01:21:03,193 --> 01:21:07,401
And what judgment would step
from this to this?

871
01:21:08,776 --> 01:21:12,443
Eyes without feeling,
feeling without sight.

872
01:21:12,984 --> 01:21:15,734
O shame, where is thy blush?

873
01:21:16,401 --> 01:21:17,859
Speak no more.

874
01:21:18,651 --> 01:21:21,484
Thou turnest my eyes into my very soul...

875
01:21:21,734 --> 01:21:25,693
and there I see such black and grained
spots as will not leave their tinct.

876
01:21:29,151 --> 01:21:33,318
Nay, but to live in the rank sweat...

877
01:21:33,401 --> 01:21:35,401
of an enseamed bed...

878
01:21:36,193 --> 01:21:38,193
stewed in corruption...

879
01:21:38,276 --> 01:21:43,109
honeying and making love
over the nasty sty.

880
01:21:43,151 --> 01:21:45,318
Speak to me no more.

881
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:49,359
These words like daggers enter
in mine ears! No more, sweet Hamlet.

882
01:21:49,443 --> 01:21:52,276
- A murderer and a villain.
- No!

883
01:21:52,318 --> 01:21:55,234
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule.

884
01:21:56,026 --> 01:21:58,776
A king of shreds and patches...

885
01:22:16,109 --> 01:22:20,067
Save me, and hover over me
with your wings, you heavenly guards.

886
01:22:23,817 --> 01:22:28,067
- What would your gracious figure?
- Alas, he's mad.

887
01:22:29,026 --> 01:22:31,984
Do you not come your tardy son to chide?

888
01:22:33,567 --> 01:22:34,942
Oh, say.

889
01:22:36,276 --> 01:22:37,692
Do not forget.

890
01:22:40,734 --> 01:22:45,234
This visitation is but to whet
thy almost blunted purpose.

891
01:22:45,901 --> 01:22:47,317
But, look.

892
01:22:48,234 --> 01:22:50,609
Amazement on thy mother sits.

893
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:55,609
Step between her and her fighting soul.

894
01:22:58,276 --> 01:23:00,276
Speak to her, Hamlet.

895
01:23:04,234 --> 01:23:05,776
How is it with you, lady?

896
01:23:05,859 --> 01:23:09,651
Alas, how is it with you,
that you do bend your eye on vacancy...

897
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:12,359
and with the incorporal air
do hold discourse?

898
01:23:12,651 --> 01:23:17,359
- O gentle son, say whereon do you look.
- On him. Look you, how pale he glares.

899
01:23:17,401 --> 01:23:18,942
To whom do you speak this?

900
01:23:19,026 --> 01:23:23,359
- Do you see nothing there?
- Nothing at all. Yet all that is, I see.

901
01:23:23,401 --> 01:23:26,651
- Nor did you nothing hear?
- No, nothing but ourselves.

902
01:23:26,776 --> 01:23:29,109
Why, look you there!
Look how it steals away.

903
01:23:29,192 --> 01:23:33,359
- My father, in his habit as he lived.
- This is the very coinage of your brain!

904
01:23:34,401 --> 01:23:37,359
It is not madness that I have uttered.

905
01:23:37,734 --> 01:23:39,859
Mother, for love of grace...

906
01:23:40,067 --> 01:23:43,276
lay not that flattering unction
to your soul...

907
01:23:43,609 --> 01:23:47,151
that not your trespass
but my madness speaks.

908
01:23:49,026 --> 01:23:50,901
Confess yourself to heaven...

909
01:23:51,442 --> 01:23:54,276
repent what's past, avoid what is to come.

910
01:23:54,359 --> 01:23:57,776
And do not spread the compost
on the weeds...

911
01:23:57,817 --> 01:23:59,234
to make them ranker.

912
01:23:59,776 --> 01:24:01,109
O Hamlet...

913
01:24:02,442 --> 01:24:05,276
thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

914
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:10,359
Throw away the worser part of it...

915
01:24:10,442 --> 01:24:13,234
and live the purer with the other half.

916
01:24:21,609 --> 01:24:23,026
Good night.

917
01:24:27,651 --> 01:24:30,526
And when you are desirous to be blessed...

918
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:33,817
I'll blessing beg of you.

919
01:24:39,317 --> 01:24:41,734
For this same lord, I do repent.

920
01:24:42,442 --> 01:24:46,567
But heaven hath pleased it so
to punish me with this, and this with me.

921
01:24:47,776 --> 01:24:51,901
I will bestow him,
and will answer well the death I gave him.

922
01:24:52,776 --> 01:24:54,609
So, again, good night.

923
01:24:56,067 --> 01:24:58,734
I must be cruel only to be kind.

924
01:24:59,734 --> 01:25:02,192
Thus bad begins
and worse remains behind.

925
01:25:04,026 --> 01:25:05,609
What shall I do?

926
01:25:06,026 --> 01:25:09,692
Let not the bloat King
tempt you again to bed...

927
01:25:10,984 --> 01:25:14,151
pinch wanton on your cheek,
call you his mouse.

928
01:25:15,234 --> 01:25:17,942
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses...

929
01:25:18,026 --> 01:25:21,276
or paddling in your neck
with his damned fingers...

930
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:24,109
make you to ravel all this matter out...

931
01:25:24,234 --> 01:25:27,151
that I essentially am not in madness...

932
01:25:27,442 --> 01:25:29,067
but mad in craft.

933
01:25:34,484 --> 01:25:36,151
Be thou assured...

934
01:25:36,276 --> 01:25:39,692
if words be made of breath,
and breath of life...

935
01:25:40,567 --> 01:25:43,817
I have no life to breathe
what thou hast said to me.

936
01:25:44,525 --> 01:25:46,567
Mother, good night, indeed.

937
01:25:57,067 --> 01:26:00,734
This counselor is now most still,
most secret...

938
01:26:01,234 --> 01:26:02,900
and most grave...

939
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:07,442
who was in life a foolish prating knave.

940
01:26:09,984 --> 01:26:12,734
Come, sir,
to draw toward an end with you.

941
01:26:13,692 --> 01:26:15,400
Good night, Mother.

942
01:26:35,484 --> 01:26:36,692
Gertrude!

943
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,525
Where is your son?

944
01:26:41,609 --> 01:26:44,192
Mine own lord, what have I seen tonight!

945
01:26:44,234 --> 01:26:46,859
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?

946
01:26:47,817 --> 01:26:48,942
Mad...

947
01:26:50,109 --> 01:26:53,525
as the sea and wind,
when both contend which is the mightier.

948
01:26:54,359 --> 01:26:56,150
In his lawless fit...

949
01:26:56,484 --> 01:26:59,442
he hath killed the unseen good old man.

950
01:27:04,442 --> 01:27:06,234
O heavy deed!

951
01:27:09,317 --> 01:27:11,817
It had been so with us, had we been there.

952
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:14,275
Guards!

953
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:18,650
Friends, go join you with some further aid.

954
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,984
Hamlet, in madness, hath Polonius slain.

955
01:27:22,275 --> 01:27:24,567
- My lord Hamlet!
- Search over there!

956
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:26,650
- My lord Hamlet!
- Hamlet!

957
01:27:29,067 --> 01:27:30,567
- Look in there!
- Over there!

958
01:27:31,234 --> 01:27:33,859
I have sent to seek him
and to find the body.

959
01:27:34,109 --> 01:27:37,775
Yet, sirs, we must not put
the strong law on him.

960
01:27:38,109 --> 01:27:40,609
He's loved of the distracted multitude.

961
01:27:42,192 --> 01:27:43,900
How now! What hath befallen?

962
01:27:43,984 --> 01:27:47,234
Where the dead body is bestowed,
my lord, we could not get from him.

963
01:27:47,275 --> 01:27:48,692
But where is he?

964
01:27:52,942 --> 01:27:54,484
Now, Hamlet...

965
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,025
where's Polonius?

966
01:27:58,775 --> 01:28:00,109
At supper.

967
01:28:01,984 --> 01:28:03,275
At supper?

968
01:28:05,734 --> 01:28:09,442
- Where?
- Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.

969
01:28:10,067 --> 01:28:13,484
A certain convocation of politic worms
are e'en at him.

970
01:28:14,567 --> 01:28:15,650
Alas.

971
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,859
A man may fish
with the worm that hath eat of a king...

972
01:28:21,734 --> 01:28:24,567
and eat of the fish that fed of that worm.

973
01:28:25,525 --> 01:28:28,234
- What dost thou mean by this?
- Nothing...

974
01:28:28,984 --> 01:28:32,984
but to show you how a king may go
a progress through the guts of a beggar.

975
01:28:38,525 --> 01:28:40,525
Where is Polonius?

976
01:28:41,025 --> 01:28:43,317
In heaven. Send thither to see.

977
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:47,692
If your messenger find him not there,
seek him in the other place yourself.

978
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,025
But if, indeed, you find him not
within this month...

979
01:28:53,067 --> 01:28:56,275
you shall nose him as you go up the stairs
into the lobby.

980
01:28:56,359 --> 01:28:58,775
- Go seek him there.
- He will stay till you come.

981
01:28:58,859 --> 01:29:02,984
Hamlet, this deed, for thine
especial safety, must send thee hence.

982
01:29:03,109 --> 01:29:05,234
Therefore prepare thyself for England.

983
01:29:05,317 --> 01:29:06,733
- For England?
- Ay, Hamlet.

984
01:29:06,817 --> 01:29:10,358
- Good.
- So is it, if thou knewest our purposes.

985
01:29:11,233 --> 01:29:13,858
I see a cherub that sees them.

986
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:17,817
But, come. For England!
Farewell, dear mother.

987
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:21,317
- Thy loving father, Hamlet.
- My mother.

988
01:29:22,567 --> 01:29:25,650
Father and mother is man and wife,
man and wife is one flesh...

989
01:29:25,733 --> 01:29:28,275
and so, my mother.

990
01:29:29,483 --> 01:29:31,150
Come, for England.

991
01:29:36,067 --> 01:29:39,400
I'll have him hence tonight.
Therefore, prepare you.

992
01:29:41,983 --> 01:29:45,817
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
and he to England shall along with you.

993
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:49,275
Arm you, I pray you,
to this speedy voyage.

994
01:29:53,733 --> 01:29:57,775
And, England, if my love
thou holdest at aught...

995
01:29:58,275 --> 01:30:00,567
thou mayest not stop our process...

996
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:04,858
which imports by letters
that these worthy men must bear...

997
01:30:06,025 --> 01:30:10,775
the present death of Hamlet.
Do it, England.

998
01:30:18,567 --> 01:30:19,775
My lord!

999
01:30:24,983 --> 01:30:28,025
- I must to England. You know that?
- Alas.

1000
01:30:28,067 --> 01:30:29,692
There's letters sealed.

1001
01:30:29,775 --> 01:30:34,525
And my two schoolfellows,
whom I will trust as I will adders fanged...

1002
01:30:35,692 --> 01:30:37,275
they bear the mandate.

1003
01:30:37,358 --> 01:30:40,025
They must sweep my way
and marshal me to knavery.

1004
01:30:40,108 --> 01:30:41,608
Let it work...

1005
01:30:42,733 --> 01:30:45,692
for I will delve one yard
below their mines...

1006
01:30:45,942 --> 01:30:47,983
and blow them at the moon.

1007
01:32:14,525 --> 01:32:17,567
How should I your true love know
from another one?

1008
01:32:21,067 --> 01:32:25,025
By his cockle hat and staff
and his sandal shoon

1009
01:32:48,733 --> 01:32:52,525
Young men will do it, if they come to it.
By cock they are to blame.

1010
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:55,900
Quoth she, "Before you tumbled me
you promised me to wed"

1011
01:32:56,233 --> 01:33:00,733
"So would I ha ' done, by yonder sun
an thou hadst not come to my bed"

1012
01:33:01,483 --> 01:33:02,775
Come, my lady.

1013
01:33:13,316 --> 01:33:17,025
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is...

1014
01:33:17,691 --> 01:33:20,650
each toy seems prologue
to some great amiss.

1015
01:33:22,358 --> 01:33:25,025
So full of artless jealousy is guilt...

1016
01:33:25,233 --> 01:33:27,983
it spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

1017
01:33:28,358 --> 01:33:31,191
Where is the beauteous majesty
of Denmark?

1018
01:33:38,483 --> 01:33:39,941
Where is the...

1019
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:42,983
How now, Ophelia?

1020
01:33:52,775 --> 01:33:55,733
He is dead and gone, lady

1021
01:33:56,816 --> 01:33:59,066
He is dead and gone

1022
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:04,025
At his head a grass-green turf

1023
01:34:05,025 --> 01:34:07,941
At his heels a stone

1024
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:33,525
How long has she been thus?

1025
01:34:40,233 --> 01:34:41,941
How do you, pretty lady?

1026
01:34:44,108 --> 01:34:45,816
Well, God 'ild you!

1027
01:34:51,233 --> 01:34:53,983
They say the owl was a baker's daughter.

1028
01:34:54,816 --> 01:34:58,858
Lord, we know what we are,
but not what we may be.

1029
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:04,608
I hope all will be well.

1030
01:35:06,858 --> 01:35:08,566
We must be patient.

1031
01:35:24,608 --> 01:35:26,900
But I cannot choose but weep...

1032
01:35:27,691 --> 01:35:30,775
to think they would lay him
in the cold ground.

1033
01:35:48,316 --> 01:35:50,441
My brother shall know of it.

1034
01:35:54,566 --> 01:35:57,608
And so I thank you for your good counsel.

1035
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:04,941
Come, my coach.

1036
01:36:08,899 --> 01:36:10,441
Poor Ophelia...

1037
01:36:11,316 --> 01:36:14,149
divided from herself and her fair judgment.

1038
01:36:15,441 --> 01:36:17,399
Good night, ladies.

1039
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:22,108
Sweet ladies, good night.

1040
01:36:23,108 --> 01:36:24,691
Follow her close.

1041
01:36:26,608 --> 01:36:28,983
Give her good watch, I pray you.

1042
01:36:30,524 --> 01:36:34,733
Quoth she, "Before you tumbled me
you promised me to wed"

1043
01:36:35,191 --> 01:36:36,316
He answers

1044
01:36:36,649 --> 01:36:39,316
"So would I ha ' done, by yonder sun

1045
01:36:40,149 --> 01:36:42,024
"An thou hadst not come to my bed"

1046
01:36:50,691 --> 01:36:52,524
O Gertrude...

1047
01:36:55,024 --> 01:36:58,274
when sorrows come,
they come not single spies...

1048
01:36:58,358 --> 01:37:00,733
but in battalions.

1049
01:37:00,941 --> 01:37:03,149
No!

1050
01:37:12,024 --> 01:37:13,233
My lady.

1051
01:38:13,816 --> 01:38:17,024
"By letters that these worthy men
must bear...

1052
01:38:17,108 --> 01:38:20,149
"the present death of Hamlet.

1053
01:38:21,316 --> 01:38:23,066
"Do it, England."

1054
01:38:40,524 --> 01:38:41,608
No!

1055
01:39:16,149 --> 01:39:17,858
Where is this king?

1056
01:39:18,691 --> 01:39:21,149
Let him stand before me!

1057
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:26,149
Where is the King?

1058
01:39:26,191 --> 01:39:29,024
- Stay, my lord Laertes.
- Hold him back!

1059
01:39:30,899 --> 01:39:33,649
O thou vile king, give me my father!

1060
01:39:33,733 --> 01:39:35,274
Calmly, good Laertes!

1061
01:39:36,191 --> 01:39:37,399
Let him go...

1062
01:39:38,732 --> 01:39:40,607
and do not fear our person.

1063
01:39:40,816 --> 01:39:42,357
Where is my father?

1064
01:39:45,774 --> 01:39:48,774
- Dead.
- Let come what comes...

1065
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:51,607
only I'll be revenged most throughly
for my father.

1066
01:39:51,774 --> 01:39:53,274
Good Laertes...

1067
01:39:54,441 --> 01:39:57,649
if you desire to know
the certainty of your dear father...

1068
01:39:59,107 --> 01:40:00,649
is it writ in your revenge...

1069
01:40:00,691 --> 01:40:02,982
that you will draw
against both friend and foe?

1070
01:40:03,066 --> 01:40:04,816
None but his enemies.

1071
01:40:04,899 --> 01:40:08,024
Why, now you speak...

1072
01:40:08,482 --> 01:40:11,357
like a good child and a true gentleman.

1073
01:40:24,357 --> 01:40:27,357
That I am guiltless of your father's death...

1074
01:40:27,857 --> 01:40:30,941
and am most sensibly in grief for it...

1075
01:40:36,399 --> 01:40:40,732
it shall as level to your judgment appear
as day does to your eye.

1076
01:41:16,316 --> 01:41:19,191
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance.

1077
01:41:31,482 --> 01:41:33,482
Pray you, love, remember.

1078
01:41:38,941 --> 01:41:41,774
And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.

1079
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:56,441
There's fennel for you, and columbines.

1080
01:42:02,191 --> 01:42:05,191
There's rue for you,
and here's some for me.

1081
01:42:07,607 --> 01:42:10,107
You must wear your rue with a difference.

1082
01:42:12,566 --> 01:42:14,149
There's a daisy.

1083
01:42:15,649 --> 01:42:19,357
I'd give you some violets,
but they withered all when my father died.

1084
01:42:19,441 --> 01:42:21,607
They say he made a good end.

1085
01:42:31,482 --> 01:42:34,941
O heavens,
is it possible a young maid's wits...

1086
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:38,149
should be as mortal as an old man's life?

1087
01:43:00,482 --> 01:43:03,316
There is a willow grows aslant the brook...

1088
01:43:03,732 --> 01:43:06,857
that shows his hoar leaves
in the glassy stream.

1089
01:43:08,315 --> 01:43:10,857
There with fantastic garlands
did she make...

1090
01:43:11,607 --> 01:43:16,190
of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies,
and long purples.

1091
01:43:18,149 --> 01:43:19,940
There, on the pendent boughs...

1092
01:43:19,982 --> 01:43:22,690
her crownet weeds clambering to hang...

1093
01:43:23,774 --> 01:43:25,857
an envious sliver broke...

1094
01:43:27,732 --> 01:43:30,524
when down her weedy trophies
and herself...

1095
01:43:31,149 --> 01:43:33,232
fell in the weeping brook.

1096
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:37,815
Her clothes spread wide...

1097
01:43:39,649 --> 01:43:42,649
and mermaid-like,
awhile they bore her up...

1098
01:43:43,565 --> 01:43:46,774
which time she chanted
snatches of old tunes...

1099
01:43:49,232 --> 01:43:51,940
as one incapable of her own distress...

1100
01:43:53,190 --> 01:43:56,857
or like a creature native
and indued unto that element.

1101
01:43:58,565 --> 01:44:00,649
But long it could not be...

1102
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:04,607
but that her garments,
heavy with their drink...

1103
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:08,607
pulled the poor wretch
from her melodious lay...

1104
01:44:09,732 --> 01:44:11,107
to muddy death.

1105
01:44:14,315 --> 01:44:16,232
Alas! Then she is drowned?

1106
01:44:17,815 --> 01:44:19,065
Drowned.

1107
01:44:36,107 --> 01:44:38,565
Methought it was very sweet

1108
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:43,565
To contract the time for my behove

1109
01:44:44,732 --> 01:44:48,065
Methought there was nothing a-meet

1110
01:44:50,149 --> 01:44:53,940
But age, with his stealing steps

1111
01:44:55,857 --> 01:44:59,024
Hath clawed me in his clutch

1112
01:45:00,774 --> 01:45:02,565
Whose grave's this, sirrah?

1113
01:45:03,982 --> 01:45:05,357
Mine, sir.

1114
01:45:06,149 --> 01:45:09,024
I think it be thine indeed,
for thou liest in it.

1115
01:45:10,899 --> 01:45:14,065
- What man dost thou dig it for?
- For no man, sir.

1116
01:45:14,149 --> 01:45:16,815
- What woman, then?
- For none, neither.

1117
01:45:20,399 --> 01:45:22,399
Who is to be buried in it?

1118
01:45:24,024 --> 01:45:27,774
One that was a woman, sir.
But, rest her soul, she's dead.

1119
01:45:28,690 --> 01:45:30,774
How absolute the knave is.

1120
01:45:34,149 --> 01:45:36,315
How long hast thou been grave-maker?

1121
01:45:36,857 --> 01:45:39,232
Since that very day
that young Hamlet was born.

1122
01:45:39,315 --> 01:45:41,232
He that is mad and sent into England.

1123
01:45:41,315 --> 01:45:44,565
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?

1124
01:45:45,315 --> 01:45:48,565
Why, because he was mad.
He shall recover his wits there.

1125
01:45:49,607 --> 01:45:52,149
Or, if he do not, 'tis no great matter there.

1126
01:45:52,357 --> 01:45:54,774
- Why?
- 'Twill not be seen in him there.

1127
01:45:54,982 --> 01:45:57,315
There the men are as mad as he.

1128
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:05,107
How long will a man lie in the earth
ere he rot?

1129
01:46:05,274 --> 01:46:09,149
Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,
some eight year, nine year.

1130
01:46:11,232 --> 01:46:12,774
Here's a skull now...

1131
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:16,482
hath lain you in the earth
some three-and-twenty years.

1132
01:46:16,649 --> 01:46:18,024
Whose was it?

1133
01:46:18,857 --> 01:46:20,940
A whoreson mad fellow's it was.

1134
01:46:21,399 --> 01:46:24,024
He poured a flagon of Rhenish
on my head once.

1135
01:46:24,107 --> 01:46:26,649
- Whose do you think it was?
- Nay, I know not.

1136
01:46:27,357 --> 01:46:30,607
This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull...

1137
01:46:31,399 --> 01:46:33,065
the King's jester.

1138
01:46:33,649 --> 01:46:35,398
- This?
- E'en that.

1139
01:46:35,898 --> 01:46:37,315
Let me see.

1140
01:46:44,482 --> 01:46:46,190
Alas, poor Yorick.

1141
01:46:48,732 --> 01:46:50,482
I knew him, Horatio...

1142
01:46:51,023 --> 01:46:54,398
a fellow of infinite jest,
of most excellent fancy.

1143
01:47:02,648 --> 01:47:05,773
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times.

1144
01:47:07,273 --> 01:47:11,148
And now,
how abhorred in my imagination it is.

1145
01:47:12,857 --> 01:47:14,857
My gorge rises at it.

1146
01:47:17,023 --> 01:47:21,565
Here hung those lips that I have kissed
I know not how oft.

1147
01:47:24,357 --> 01:47:26,315
Where be your gibes now?

1148
01:47:28,065 --> 01:47:32,065
Your gambols, your songs,
your flashes of merriment...

1149
01:47:32,148 --> 01:47:34,690
that were wont to set the table on a roar?

1150
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,690
Not one now, to mock your own grinning?

1151
01:47:44,023 --> 01:47:45,690
Quite chopfallen?

1152
01:47:48,523 --> 01:47:51,982
Now get you to my lady's chamber...

1153
01:47:52,898 --> 01:47:54,815
and tell her...

1154
01:47:54,857 --> 01:47:57,273
let her paint an inch thick...

1155
01:47:59,565 --> 01:48:01,690
to this favor she must come.

1156
01:48:04,982 --> 01:48:06,857
Make her laugh at that.

1157
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:27,482
The King, the courtiers.

1158
01:48:33,648 --> 01:48:35,648
Who is this they follow?

1159
01:48:48,107 --> 01:48:50,023
Lay her in the earth.

1160
01:48:52,023 --> 01:48:56,232
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
may violets spring.

1161
01:49:05,273 --> 01:49:07,065
Sweets to the sweet.

1162
01:49:11,315 --> 01:49:12,607
Farewell.

1163
01:49:17,482 --> 01:49:20,273
I hoped thou shouldst have been
my Hamlet's wife.

1164
01:49:21,190 --> 01:49:24,190
I thought thy bride-bed to have decked,
sweet maid...

1165
01:49:24,898 --> 01:49:27,273
and not to have strewed thy grave.

1166
01:49:35,190 --> 01:49:38,732
Hold off the earth awhile, till I have
caught her once more in mine arms.

1167
01:49:38,815 --> 01:49:40,482
O rose of May...

1168
01:49:42,190 --> 01:49:43,607
dear maid...

1169
01:49:44,857 --> 01:49:46,607
kind sister.

1170
01:50:00,690 --> 01:50:02,648
The devil take thy soul!

1171
01:50:02,732 --> 01:50:05,356
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat...

1172
01:50:05,773 --> 01:50:08,065
for I have in me something dangerous...

1173
01:50:08,106 --> 01:50:11,231
which let thy wiseness fear.
Hold off thy hand!

1174
01:50:11,315 --> 01:50:12,773
Pluck them asunder!

1175
01:50:14,481 --> 01:50:16,148
Good my lord, be quiet.

1176
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:18,356
I loved Ophelia.

1177
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:22,231
Forty thousand brothers could not...

1178
01:50:22,273 --> 01:50:24,440
with all their quantity of love...

1179
01:50:24,523 --> 01:50:26,065
make up my sum.

1180
01:50:28,315 --> 01:50:30,023
What wilt thou do for her?

1181
01:50:30,606 --> 01:50:32,690
'Swounds, show me what thou wilt do!

1182
01:50:40,273 --> 01:50:43,398
Hear you, sir, I loved you ever.

1183
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:48,231
But it is no matter.

1184
01:50:49,773 --> 01:50:53,023
Let Hercules himself do what he may...

1185
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:57,648
the cat will mew
and dog will have his day.

1186
01:51:21,981 --> 01:51:24,815
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.

1187
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:38,065
Will you be ruled by me?

1188
01:51:38,148 --> 01:51:41,190
I will, my lord,
so you will not overrule me to a peace.

1189
01:51:41,273 --> 01:51:42,981
To thine own peace.

1190
01:51:43,565 --> 01:51:44,690
But tell me, sir...

1191
01:51:44,815 --> 01:51:48,190
why you proceeded not against
these crimes so capital in nature?

1192
01:51:48,273 --> 01:51:50,273
For two especial reasons:

1193
01:51:50,606 --> 01:51:54,065
The Queen his mother
lives almost by his looks.

1194
01:51:55,523 --> 01:51:57,190
And for myself.

1195
01:51:58,023 --> 01:52:00,565
My virtue or my plague,
be it either which...

1196
01:52:01,856 --> 01:52:04,356
she is so conjunctive to my life and soul...

1197
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:07,815
that, as the star moves
not but in his sphere...

1198
01:52:09,065 --> 01:52:11,273
I could not but by her.

1199
01:52:16,606 --> 01:52:20,481
The other motive is the great love
the general gender bear him.

1200
01:52:22,231 --> 01:52:26,398
Laertes, was your father dear to you?

1201
01:52:27,606 --> 01:52:31,273
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
a face without a heart?

1202
01:52:31,356 --> 01:52:32,481
Why ask you this?

1203
01:52:32,565 --> 01:52:36,231
Not that I think
you did not love your father. But, Laertes...

1204
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:41,231
what would you undertake
to show yourself your father's son...

1205
01:52:41,273 --> 01:52:43,815
in deed more than in words?

1206
01:52:47,273 --> 01:52:50,065
To cut his throat in the church.

1207
01:52:54,106 --> 01:52:56,565
Revenge should have no bounds.

1208
01:52:58,773 --> 01:53:00,481
That we would do...

1209
01:53:01,523 --> 01:53:03,606
we should do when we would.

1210
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,315
I'll work the prince...

1211
01:53:10,481 --> 01:53:15,398
to an exploit now ripe in my device,
under the which he cannot choose but fall.

1212
01:53:16,065 --> 01:53:17,856
And for his death...

1213
01:53:20,481 --> 01:53:22,648
no wind of blame shall breathe...

1214
01:53:22,731 --> 01:53:26,231
but even his mother
shall uncharge the practice...

1215
01:53:27,315 --> 01:53:29,148
and call it accident.

1216
01:53:31,606 --> 01:53:33,065
Lord Hamlet!

1217
01:53:43,273 --> 01:53:45,898
Your lordship is right welcome
back to Denmark.

1218
01:53:46,148 --> 01:53:48,148
I humbly thank you, sir.

1219
01:53:48,606 --> 01:53:50,898
Sweet lord,
if your lordship were at leisure...

1220
01:53:50,981 --> 01:53:53,439
I should impart a thing to you
from His Majesty.

1221
01:53:53,523 --> 01:53:56,439
I will receive it, sir,
will all diligence of spirit.

1222
01:53:56,481 --> 01:53:59,814
Put your bonnet to his right use.
'Tis for the head.

1223
01:54:00,398 --> 01:54:02,689
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.

1224
01:54:02,773 --> 01:54:06,148
No, believe me, it is very cold.
The wind is northerly.

1225
01:54:06,648 --> 01:54:09,189
My lord, His Majesty bade me tell you...

1226
01:54:09,231 --> 01:54:11,856
that he has laid a great wager
on your head.

1227
01:54:12,106 --> 01:54:15,189
Laertes, believe me,
is an absolute gentleman.

1228
01:54:15,273 --> 01:54:18,356
I well know
you are not ignorant of his skills.

1229
01:54:19,064 --> 01:54:21,398
To know a man well were to know himself.

1230
01:54:22,523 --> 01:54:25,689
The king hath wagered
six Barbary horses...

1231
01:54:26,023 --> 01:54:27,981
that in a dozen passes between you...

1232
01:54:28,064 --> 01:54:30,523
he shall not exceed you three hits.

1233
01:54:30,564 --> 01:54:32,731
It would come
to immediate trial tomorrow...

1234
01:54:32,814 --> 01:54:35,648
if your lordship would vouchsafe
a timely answer.

1235
01:54:36,564 --> 01:54:38,814
I will win for him, if I can.

1236
01:54:39,606 --> 01:54:42,564
If not, I gain nothing but my shame
and the odd hits.

1237
01:54:42,606 --> 01:54:44,689
Shall I deliver you even so?

1238
01:54:45,773 --> 01:54:48,523
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready...

1239
01:54:49,314 --> 01:54:53,564
now or whensoever,
provided I be so able as now.

1240
01:55:11,773 --> 01:55:14,731
- You will lose this wager, my lord.
- I do not think so.

1241
01:55:14,773 --> 01:55:18,439
I have been in continual practice.
I shall win at the odds.

1242
01:55:19,814 --> 01:55:23,106
Thou wouldst not think
how ill all's here about my heart.

1243
01:55:26,773 --> 01:55:28,564
But it is no matter.

1244
01:55:29,398 --> 01:55:32,148
If your mind dislike anything, obey it.

1245
01:55:32,356 --> 01:55:35,398
Not a whit. We defy augury.

1246
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:39,273
I have it.

1247
01:55:40,314 --> 01:55:43,148
When in your motion you are hot and dry...

1248
01:55:44,648 --> 01:55:47,523
I'll have a chalice, which if he but sip...

1249
01:55:47,689 --> 01:55:49,731
our purpose may hold there.

1250
01:55:49,898 --> 01:55:52,314
For that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.

1251
01:55:53,523 --> 01:55:55,564
I bought an unction of a mountebank...

1252
01:55:55,648 --> 01:55:59,689
so mortal that, if I but scratch him,
it will mean death.

1253
01:56:03,064 --> 01:56:06,814
It warms the very sickness in my heart
that I shall tell him to his teeth:

1254
01:56:06,898 --> 01:56:08,523
"Thus diest thou."

1255
01:56:20,273 --> 01:56:23,523
There is special providence
in the fall of a sparrow.

1256
01:56:25,814 --> 01:56:28,023
If it be now, it is not to come.

1257
01:56:29,606 --> 01:56:31,856
If it be not to come, it will be now.

1258
01:56:34,106 --> 01:56:36,939
If it be not now, yet it will come.

1259
01:56:47,606 --> 01:56:49,356
The readiness is all.

1260
01:58:01,731 --> 01:58:03,106
All salute!

1261
01:58:07,772 --> 01:58:11,481
Come, Hamlet, come,
and take this hand from me.

1262
01:58:16,189 --> 01:58:19,064
Give me your pardon, sir.
I have done you wrong...

1263
01:58:19,897 --> 01:58:22,481
but pardon it, as you are a gentleman.

1264
01:58:22,564 --> 01:58:24,522
Sir, in this audience...

1265
01:58:24,731 --> 01:58:27,814
free me so far
in your most generous thoughts...

1266
01:58:28,189 --> 01:58:31,856
that I have shot my arrow over the house
and hurt my brother.

1267
01:58:32,231 --> 01:58:33,814
I am satisfied in nature...

1268
01:58:33,897 --> 01:58:36,481
but in terms of honor, I stand aloof...

1269
01:58:36,606 --> 01:58:38,647
and will no reconcilement.

1270
01:58:41,897 --> 01:58:44,772
Yet I receive your offered love like love...

1271
01:58:44,856 --> 01:58:46,439
and will not wrong it.

1272
01:58:47,397 --> 01:58:49,231
I embrace it freely...

1273
01:58:49,939 --> 01:58:52,731
and will this brother's wager frankly play.

1274
01:58:53,356 --> 01:58:55,022
Give us the sword!

1275
01:58:57,606 --> 01:58:58,897
Come, one for me.

1276
01:58:59,439 --> 01:59:02,689
- Cousin Hamlet, you know the wager?
- Very well, my lord.

1277
01:59:02,772 --> 01:59:05,272
Your Grace has laid the odds
on the weaker side.

1278
01:59:05,356 --> 01:59:08,189
I do not fear it. I have seen you both.

1279
01:59:08,231 --> 01:59:10,981
Set me the stoup of wine upon that table.

1280
01:59:11,147 --> 01:59:13,731
If Hamlet give the first or second hit...

1281
01:59:13,814 --> 01:59:17,231
the King shall drink
to Hamlet's better breath.

1282
01:59:17,897 --> 01:59:22,397
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
the trumpet to the cannoneer without...

1283
01:59:22,481 --> 01:59:25,981
the cannons to the heavens,
the heaven to earth:

1284
01:59:26,189 --> 01:59:30,106
"Now the King drinks to Hamlet!"

1285
02:00:13,231 --> 02:00:14,731
What's wrong, Laertes?

1286
02:00:22,397 --> 02:00:23,481
Higher, Laertes!

1287
02:00:36,397 --> 02:00:38,480
Go to it, Laertes!

1288
02:00:48,730 --> 02:00:50,355
- One!
- No!

1289
02:00:51,397 --> 02:00:54,022
- A hit, a very palpable hit.
- Well, again!

1290
02:00:54,939 --> 02:00:56,022
Stay.

1291
02:01:00,814 --> 02:01:02,647
Give me drink.

1292
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:04,772
Hamlet...

1293
02:01:05,689 --> 02:01:08,314
this pearl is thine.

1294
02:01:09,689 --> 02:01:11,480
Here's to thy health!

1295
02:01:23,522 --> 02:01:26,564
I'll play this bout first. Set it by a while.

1296
02:02:22,564 --> 02:02:24,064
Stay!

1297
02:02:51,855 --> 02:02:54,980
- Another hit! What say you?
- A touch, I do confess.

1298
02:02:55,814 --> 02:02:59,189
- Our son shall win.
- He's scant of breath.

1299
02:03:00,814 --> 02:03:04,105
The queen carouses
to thy fortune, Hamlet.

1300
02:03:04,189 --> 02:03:07,355
Gertrude, do not drink.

1301
02:03:08,689 --> 02:03:11,272
I will, my lord, I pray you pardon me.

1302
02:03:20,189 --> 02:03:22,689
I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.

1303
02:03:23,522 --> 02:03:25,605
Come, let me wipe thy face.

1304
02:04:00,855 --> 02:04:02,480
This is too heavy.

1305
02:04:19,355 --> 02:04:21,730
Come for the third, Laertes.
You do but dally.

1306
02:04:21,813 --> 02:04:23,980
Say you so? Come on!

1307
02:04:30,563 --> 02:04:32,397
Laertes, you have practiced much.

1308
02:04:42,772 --> 02:04:44,188
Parry again, lord.

1309
02:05:03,647 --> 02:05:05,147
Come, my lord!

1310
02:05:16,855 --> 02:05:18,188
My lord Hamlet!

1311
02:05:29,147 --> 02:05:30,897
Break it!

1312
02:05:31,230 --> 02:05:34,563
Nothing, neither way. Part, sirs!

1313
02:06:02,563 --> 02:06:03,772
'Tis unfair!

1314
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:12,188
Nay, come again!

1315
02:06:22,105 --> 02:06:23,605
Fight, Laertes!

1316
02:06:26,855 --> 02:06:29,272
Look to the Queen there! Ho!

1317
02:06:29,647 --> 02:06:31,647
They bleed on both sides.

1318
02:06:37,772 --> 02:06:39,772
- How does my lord?
- How does the Queen?

1319
02:06:39,855 --> 02:06:42,063
She swoons to see them bleed!

1320
02:06:44,355 --> 02:06:45,438
No!

1321
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:48,855
The drink.

1322
02:06:55,688 --> 02:06:57,522
O my dear Hamlet...

1323
02:07:21,855 --> 02:07:23,647
O villainy!

1324
02:07:24,022 --> 02:07:26,313
Ho! Let the doors be locked!

1325
02:07:26,647 --> 02:07:28,272
Treachery! Seek it out.

1326
02:07:28,313 --> 02:07:29,813
It is here, Hamlet.

1327
02:07:30,230 --> 02:07:31,980
Hamlet, thou art slain.

1328
02:07:32,063 --> 02:07:34,480
No medicine in the world
can do thee good.

1329
02:07:35,646 --> 02:07:37,855
The treacherous instrument
is in thy hand...

1330
02:07:37,938 --> 02:07:39,855
unbated and envenomed.

1331
02:07:41,021 --> 02:07:43,480
The foul practice hath turned itself on me.

1332
02:07:44,021 --> 02:07:46,980
I am justly killed with mine own treachery.

1333
02:07:47,605 --> 02:07:50,438
Exchange forgiveness with me,
noble Hamlet.

1334
02:07:50,813 --> 02:07:53,146
Mine and my father's death
come not upon thee.

1335
02:07:53,230 --> 02:07:54,563
Nor mine on thee.

1336
02:07:54,980 --> 02:07:56,688
I can no more!

1337
02:08:02,938 --> 02:08:04,063
The King...

1338
02:08:04,188 --> 02:08:05,855
The King's to blame.

1339
02:08:13,896 --> 02:08:15,605
The point envenomed.

1340
02:08:20,021 --> 02:08:22,688
Then, venom, to thy work!

1341
02:08:28,188 --> 02:08:31,230
Yet defend me, friends.

1342
02:08:36,730 --> 02:08:41,063
Here, thou incestuous, murderous,
damned Dane...

1343
02:08:41,563 --> 02:08:43,438
drink of this potion.

1344
02:08:44,355 --> 02:08:47,480
Is thy union here? Follow my mother!

1345
02:09:10,730 --> 02:09:12,438
I am dead, Horatio.

1346
02:09:26,313 --> 02:09:27,896
Wretched queen...

1347
02:09:29,271 --> 02:09:30,438
adieu.

1348
02:09:43,938 --> 02:09:47,896
You that look pale
and tremble at this chance:

1349
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:50,480
Had I but time...

1350
02:09:50,938 --> 02:09:55,313
as this fell sergeant, death,
is strict in his arrest...

1351
02:09:57,855 --> 02:09:59,771
I could tell you...

1352
02:10:01,146 --> 02:10:02,688
But let it be.

1353
02:10:08,771 --> 02:10:10,480
Horatio, I am dead.

1354
02:10:12,980 --> 02:10:16,355
Thou livest.
Report me and my cause aright.

1355
02:10:18,730 --> 02:10:21,771
God, Horatio, what a wounded name...

1356
02:10:22,105 --> 02:10:25,105
things standing thus unknown,
shall live behind me.

1357
02:10:26,813 --> 02:10:29,688
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart...

1358
02:10:33,188 --> 02:10:35,438
absent thee from felicity awhile...

1359
02:10:35,521 --> 02:10:39,730
and then in this harsh world
draw thy breath in pain...

1360
02:10:40,771 --> 02:10:42,480
to tell my story.

1361
02:10:47,521 --> 02:10:49,146
I die, Horatio.

1362
02:10:52,813 --> 02:10:56,188
The potent poison
quite o'er-crows my spirit.

1363
02:11:00,188 --> 02:11:03,688
The rest is silence.

1364
02:11:16,813 --> 02:11:18,979
Good night, sweet prince...

1365
02:11:19,646 --> 02:11:22,854
and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.

1366
02:14:31,646 --> 02:14:33,021
English
