On the last November eleventh the number one stayed alone feels very lonely. So it decided to walk out to meet some friends, OK a girl friend.firstly it meeting the number two. but one just talked with two very few words and left. Later it met number eight, one just talked with two very few words and left again.It walked forward and met the square of two, one just talked with it very few words and left.Later it met the square root of two, one just talked with two very few words and left again.It walked forward and met the number pai, one just talked with it very few words and left.Later it met the imagine i, one just talked with two very few words and left again.At last it met the number zero, one turned around and left even with a word.

One prayed to the god:"god, god, why can't I find a friend, a girl is suit to me?"God answered:"You had met a lot of numbers, why did you not like them?"
One answered:"I don't like them. All of them had some shortcoming or weak points".God was surprised:"Really? say it!"

One said:"Firstly I met two, she seemed very tired and in a low mood, her head was down and can't walk. she was just crawling. Then I met eight, she had a fat body and a fat head. she seems too proud of herself. Then I met the square of two, oh she already had got a baby. Later it the square root of two, she is very pity, she even just had a half of a house an she is an irrational number. The I met pai, she had a whole house. But she is round and sleek and more she is also irrational number just like the square root of two. Then I met i - the imagine, she is beautiful but it seems we didn't walk on the same direction. At last I met zero, she was so poor, she had nothing and even can make me nothing!"

God laughed and said:"Why did you only notice the shortcoming or disadvantage of others. You really need to try to find highlight and advantage from others. For example, number two just head and crawl because she is much taller than you if she stand up and head. She was a little tired just she is very busy after all she is a prime!. Number eight is fat but many Chinese like her because her Chinese pronunciation while none likes you. Number four - the square of two has real power. And the square root of two had a half of house at least. The number pai can occupy the largest space with the same line, she is a genius! the imagine i is the image of yourself in the other world, the world was composed by the reals and imagines. At the last the number zero has the greatest power, yes, it can change all number to nothing but it can also make it ten times. So everyone had his shortcoming and disadvantage, but you can only see that. You must see their power, genius and advantages. Work with them then all of you can build up the world together."
