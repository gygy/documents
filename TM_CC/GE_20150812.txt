hello everyone, it's my first time to take the general evaluator, and it is also the last role which I have not taken.

I thought it is the most difficult role and I don't know how to make it successfully.

So I seeked the help from the manual <Competent Leadership>.

In this book we can find the requirements list for different roles on different fields.

I summarized them in an excel doc, printed them and distributed them.

I will evaluate this whole meeting based on these.

Maybe this doc is far from pretty and we can update it step by step from our practice.

I hope these will make our meeting from success to success.

Today I will mainly focus on the performance of Youchao - our speech evaluator, Qinqin - our table topic evaluator, Jeff - your toast master and the other roles in the evaluation team: Jack - our timer, ah counter - Gang.

Firstly let's welcome our timer - Jack.

Now let's welcome our ah counter - Gang.
